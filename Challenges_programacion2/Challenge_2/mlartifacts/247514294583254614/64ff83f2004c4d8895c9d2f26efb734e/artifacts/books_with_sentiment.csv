Yet today there is only oneâhomo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen to us?Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas.Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become?Featuring 27 photographs, 6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. ...more",renowned historian comes groundbreaking narrative creation international explores ways biology history defined us enhanced understanding means hundred thousand years ago least six different species humans inhabited earth yet today renowned historian comes groundbreaking narrative creation international explores ways biology history defined us enhanced understanding means hundred thousand years ago least six different species humans inhabited earth yet today sapiens happened others may happen us books history humanity pursue either historical biological approach yuval noah harari breaks mold highly original book begins years ago appearance modern cognition examining role evolving humans played global ecosystem charting rise empires sapiens integrates history science reconsider accepted narratives connect past developments contemporary concerns examine specific events within context larger harari also compels us look ahead last decades humans begun bend laws natural selection governed life past four billion years acquiring ability design world around us also leading us want become featuring photographs maps provocative insightful work sure spark debate essential reading aficionados jared diamond james gleick matt ridley robert wright sharon moalem,0.9583

More than 140 years pre-Hillary, there was Victoria Woodhull. This book takes you back with a breathtaking, present-tense bird's eye view into a time when women's liberation was primarily confined to one woman's very capable, independent mind. I couldn't put it down.""---Ruth Buzzi, Golden Globe Award winner and Television Hall of Fame inductee""Sadly, too many Americans have never heard of Victoria Woodhull, let alone learned of her story: her revolutionary campaign for the presidency at a time when women weren't even allowed to vote, her support for worker's rights, or her feminist commitment to equality, a century before the official battle over the Equal Rights Amendment. But in The Coming Woman, Karen Hicks brings Woodhull's efforts to life, and reminds us that some of our nation's greatest figures aren't always featured in the history books. It is a riveting account of an amazing woman and her struggle for justice and human dignity, told in an engaging and eminently readable style.""-Tim Wise, author, ""White Like Me: Reflections on Race from a Privileged Son""""The Coming Woman"" is a novel based on the life of feminist Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for U.S. President, 50 years before women could even vote!Running for President wasn't Victoria's only first as a woman. She was also the first to own a successful Wall Street firm, the first to publish a successful national newspaper, and the first to head the two-million-member Spiritualist Association. She was the first woman to enter the Senate Judiciary Committee chambers to petition for woman's suffrage, her argument changing the entire focus of the suffragist movement by pointing out that the 14th and 15th Amendments already gave women the vote.In her campaign for the Presidency, Victoria Woodhull boldly addressed many of the issues we still face today: equal pay for equal work; freedom in love; corporate greed and political corruption fueled by powerful lobbyists; and the increasing disparity between the rich and the poor, to name only a few. Her outspoken and common-sense ideas may shed a new perspective on the parallel conundrums of today's world.This bold, beautiful, and sexually progressive woman dared to take on society and religion. To make an example of the hypocrisy in what Mark Twain dubbed The Gilded Age, she exposed the extramarital affairs of the most popular religious figure of the day (Henry Ward Beecher). This led to her persecution and imprisonment and the longest, most infamous trial of the 19th century. But it did not stop her fight for equality.Victoria's epic story, set in the late 1800s, comes to life in a modern, fictional style, while staying true to the actual words and views of the many well-known characters. ...more",heart soul karen hicks coming woman make fall love victoria woodhull friedman author governor heart texas kind confidence would take woman buck old boy club politics years victoria woodhull book takes back heart soul karen hicks coming woman make fall love victoria woodhull friedman author governor heart texas kind confidence would take woman buck old boy club politics years victoria woodhull book takes back breathtaking bird eye view time women liberation primarily confined one woman capable independent mind could put buzzi golden globe award winner television hall fame inductee sadly many americans never heard victoria woodhull let alone learned story revolutionary campaign presidency time women even allowed vote support worker rights feminist commitment equality century official battle equal rights amendment coming woman karen hicks brings woodhull efforts life reminds us nation greatest figures always featured history books riveting account amazing woman struggle justice human dignity told engaging eminently readable style wise author white like reflections race privileged son coming woman novel based life feminist victoria woodhull first woman run president years women could even vote running president victoria first woman also first successful wall street firm first publish successful national newspaper first head spiritualist association first woman enter senate judiciary committee chambers petition woman suffrage argument changing entire focus suffragist movement pointing amendments already gave women campaign presidency victoria woodhull boldly addressed many issues still face today equal pay equal work freedom love corporate greed political corruption fueled powerful lobbyists increasing disparity rich poor name outspoken ideas may shed new perspective parallel conundrums today bold beautiful sexually progressive woman dared take society religion make example hypocrisy mark twain dubbed gilded age exposed extramarital affairs popular religious figure day henry ward beecher led persecution imprisonment longest infamous trial century stop fight epic story set late comes life modern fictional style staying true actual words views many characters,0.9986

The sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the boys defeated elite rivals first from eastern and British universities and finally the German crew rowing for Adolf Hitler in the Olympic games in Berlin, 1936. The emotional heart of the story lies with one rower, Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, who rows not for glory, but to regain his shattered self-regard and to find a place he can call home. The crew is assembledÂ  by an enigmatic coach and mentored by a visionary, eccentric British boat builder, but it is their trust in each other that makes them a victorious team. They remind the country of what can be done when everyone quite literally pulls togetherâa perfect melding of commitment, determination, and optimism. Drawing on the boysâ own diaries and journals, their photos and memories of a once-in-a-lifetime shared dream, The Boys in the Boat is an irresistible story about beating the odds and finding hope in the most desperate of timesâthe improbable, intimate story of nine working-class boys from the American west who, in the depths of the Great Depression, showed the world what true grit really meant. It will appeal to readers of Erik Larson, Timothy Egan, James Bradley, and David Halberstam's The Amateurs. ...more",readers laura hillenbrand seabiscuit unbroken dramatic story american rowing team stunned world hitler berlin olympics daniel james robust book tells story university crew epic quest olympic gold medal team transformed sport grabbed attention readers laura hillenbrand seabiscuit unbroken dramatic story american rowing team stunned world hitler berlin olympics daniel james robust book tells story university crew epic quest olympic gold medal team transformed sport grabbed attention millions americans sons loggers shipyard workers farmers boys defeated elite rivals first eastern british universities finally german crew rowing adolf hitler olympic games berlin emotional heart story lies one rower joe rantz teenager without family prospects rows glory regain shattered find place call home crew assembledâ enigmatic coach mentored visionary eccentric british boat builder trust makes victorious team remind country done everyone quite literally pulls perfect melding commitment determination optimism drawing diaries journals photos memories shared dream boys boat irresistible story beating odds finding hope desperate improbable intimate story nine boys american west depths great depression showed world true grit really meant appeal readers erik larson timothy egan james bradley david halberstam amateurs,0.9869

There is in her art the vulnerability of one who lives inside of the stories that she gathers in this remarkable collection. Her poems set off alarms even as they transform the world she inhabits, showing us, in the process, exactly what she asks of Romare Beardenâs art: ââ¦how not to // assign all blackness near the sea / a captivity.â This is one of the many sweet contradictions in the black maria, which âis a black flag / wounding the pastoral.â I am deeply thankful that we have a poet of her unique and singular talent writing today."" âKwame DawesTaking its name from the moon's dark plains, misidentified as seas by early astronomers, the black maria investigates African diasporic histories, the consequences of racism within American culture, and the question of human identity.

His powerful new collection offers a poetry that simultaneously explores hope and horror while documenting the transformative processes of coping. You canât bury them all follows the narratives we construct to survive the tragic failures of our humanity to their very end: everything thatâs buried by snow, dirt, and ash, just like everything thatâs buried by politics, homophobia, sexism, racism, religion; and history is resurrected, demanding to be heard and addressed.In Woodcockâs poetry, how we deal with what resurfaces is the key. What do those who suffer really mean to those who have abandoned them to small, conscience-soothing charitable donations or the occasional tweet? How can the poet, or anyone else, sleep at night knowing homosexuals are being thrown off building tops, after one steps into a hole and finds an abandoned corpse in an Azeri cemetery, or after the elders of an Aboriginal community are left helpless against those who only want to exploit them? Still, You canât bury them all demonstrates that the world is not just the horrific place the media often portrays.

This project turned into a quest to discover the secrets of the neighborhoodâs flora and fauna, and yielded more than names and trivia: Johnson developed a relationship with his nonhuman neighbors.Johnson argues that learning to see the world afresh, like a child, shifts the way we think about nature: Instead of something distant and abstract, nature becomes realâall at once comical, annoying, and beautiful. This shift can add tremendous value to our lives, and it might just be the first step in saving the world.No matter where we liveâcity, country, oceanside, ormountainsâthere are wonders that we walk past every day. Unseen City widens the pinhole of our perspective by allowing us to view the world from the high-altitude eyes of a turkey vulture and the distinctly low-altitude eyes of a snail. The narrative allows us to eavesdrop on the comically frenetic life of a squirrel and peer deep into the past with a ginkgo biloba tree. Each of these organisms has something unique to tell us about our neighborhoods and, chapter by chapter, Unseen City takes us on a journey that is part nature lesson and part love letter to the worldâs urban jungles.

"Unbound: How Eight Technologies Made Us Human, Transformed Society, and Brought Our World to the Brink","Although we usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors began to create the first technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and weapons. Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing Although we usually think of technology as something unique to modern times, our ancestors began to create the first technologies millions of years ago in the form of prehistoric tools and weapons. Over time, eight key technologies gradually freed us from the limitations of our animal origins.The fabrication of weapons, the mastery of fire, and the technologies of clothing and shelter radically restructured the human body, enabling us to walk upright, shed our body hair, and migrate out of tropical Africa. Symbolic communication transformed human evolution from a slow biological process into a fast cultural process. The invention of agriculture revolutionized the relationship between humanity and the environment, and the technologies of interaction led to the birth of civilization. Precision machinery spawned the industrial revolution and the rise of nation-states; and in the next metamorphosis, digital technologies may well unite all of humanity for the benefit of future generations.Synthesizing the findings of primatology, paleontology, archeology, history, and anthropology, Richard Currier reinterprets and retells the modern narrative of human evolution that began with the discovery of Lucy and other Australopithecus fossils. But the same forces that allowed us to integrate technology into every aspect of our daily lives have also brought us to the brink of planetary catastrophe. Unbound explains both how we got here and how human society must be transformed again to achieve a sustainable future.Technology: âThe deliberate modification of any natural object or substance with forethought to achieve a specific end or to serve a specific purpose.â ...more",although usually think technology something unique modern times ancestors began create first technologies millions years ago form prehistoric tools weapons time eight key technologies gradually freed us limitations animal fabrication weapons mastery fire technologies clothing although usually think technology something unique modern times ancestors began create first technologies millions years ago form prehistoric tools weapons time eight key technologies gradually freed us limitations animal fabrication weapons mastery fire technologies clothing shelter radically restructured human body enabling us walk upright shed body hair migrate tropical africa symbolic communication transformed human evolution slow biological process fast cultural process invention agriculture revolutionized relationship humanity environment technologies interaction led birth civilization precision machinery spawned industrial revolution rise next metamorphosis digital technologies may well unite humanity benefit future findings primatology paleontology archeology history anthropology richard currier reinterprets retells modern narrative human evolution began discovery lucy australopithecus fossils forces allowed us integrate technology every aspect daily lives also brought us brink planetary catastrophe unbound explains got human society must transformed achieve sustainable deliberate modification natural object substance forethought achieve specific end serve specific,-0.6808

Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus: How Growth Became the Enemy of Prosperity,"Capital in the Twenty-First Century meets The Second Machine Age in this stunning and optimistic tour de force on the promise and peril of the digital economy, from one of the most brilliant social critics of our time.

Digital technology was supposed to usher in a new age of endless prosperity, but so far it has been used to put industrial capitalism on steroids, making it harder for people and businesses to keep up. Social networks surrender their original missions to more immediately profitable data mining, while brokerage houses abandon value investing for algorithms that drain markets and our 401ks alike--all tactics driven by the need to stoke growth by any means necessary. Instead of taking this opportunity to reprogram our economy for sustainability, we have doubled down on growth as its core command. We have reached the limits of this approach. We must escape the growth trap, once and for all.Â Media scholar and technology author Douglas Rushkoff--one of today's most original and influential thinkers--argues for a new economic program that utilizes the unique distributive power of the internet while breaking free of the winner-take-all system the growth trap leaves in its wake. Drawing on sources both contemporary and historical, Rushkoff pioneers a new understanding of the old economic paradigm, from central currency to debt to corporations and labor.Most importantly, he offers a series of practical steps for businesses, consumers, investors, and policymakers to remake the economic operating system from the inside out--and prosper along the way. Instead of boycotting Wal-Mart or overtaxing the wealthy, we simply implement strategies that foster the creation of value by stakeholders other than just ourselves. From our currency to our labor to the corporation, every aspect of the economy can be reprogrammed with minimal disruption to create a more equitably distributed prosperity for all.Inspiring and challenging, Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus provides a pragmatic, optimistic, and human-centered model for economic progress in the digital age. ...more",capital century meets second machine age stunning optimistic tour de force promise peril digital economy one brilliant social critics time digital technology supposed usher new age endless prosperity far used put industrial capitalism steroids makin capital century meets second machine age stunning optimistic tour de force promise peril digital economy one brilliant social critics time digital technology supposed usher new age endless prosperity far used put industrial capitalism steroids making harder people businesses keep social networks surrender original missions immediately profitable data mining brokerage houses abandon value investing algorithms drain markets alike tactics driven need stoke growth means necessary instead taking opportunity reprogram economy sustainability doubled growth core command reached limits approach must escape growth trap media scholar technology author douglas rushkoff one today original influential thinkers argues new economic program utilizes unique distributive power internet breaking free system growth trap leaves wake drawing sources contemporary historical rushkoff pioneers new understanding old economic paradigm central currency debt corporations importantly offers series practical steps businesses consumers investors policymakers remake economic operating system inside prosper along way instead boycotting overtaxing wealthy simply implement strategies foster creation value stakeholders currency labor corporation every aspect economy reprogrammed minimal disruption create equitably distributed prosperity challenging throwing rocks google bus provides pragmatic optimistic model economic progress digital age,0.9898

The Torch Is Passed: A Harding Family Story,"Andrea Harding is a recent college graduate looking forward to attending Duke Law School when her world is turned upside down by the shooting of her father, Nicholas, and uncle, Michael, in a surprising and puzzling attack. They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in I Andrea Harding is a recent college graduate looking forward to attending Duke Law School when her world is turned upside down by the shooting of her father, Nicholas, and uncle, Michael, in a surprising and puzzling attack. They are the only family she has, aside from her paternal grandmother Dorothy, so when her uncle dies from the attack and her father lays comatose in ICU, it falls to Andrea to not only investigate who would want to kill her father and uncle, but also to oversee Harding Industries, the family company. When her fatherâs longtime attorney and one of a handful of family friends, Beth Cowling, rushes to help Andrea long distance, the youngest Harding soon finds herself surrounded by a bevy of intriguing new friends and helpers. First to arrive is Bethâs own daughter, Riva, acting as Andreaâs attorney after Andrea is violently attacked in her fatherâs home, where she grew up, forcing her to kill both would-be assassins. When Nicholasâs on again/off again lover, state prosecutor and gubernatorial hopeful Kerry Marcus, is equally at a loss to name suspects in the Harding family attacks, Riva begins her own investigation into the short list of family friends and colleagues, including Don Marshall, former colleague of Nicholasâs at Marshall Pharmaceutical, which Don now runs, and Donâs wife Karen. Marshall has a shady past, including an incident at his company that also involved Andreaâs father. She also looks closely at Marcus Ricci, father of Andreaâs closest high school friend, Jason. After Jasonâs death from leukemia, Ricci becomes like a second father to Andrea. Ricci is also widely believed to have ties to the New Jersey mob. But Beth has another contact she wants involved in the investigation, Deirdre Southington, daughter of Bethâs old friend Cordelia Southington. The Southington family has more money than God, as well as, through Deirdre, more contacts in the intriguing world of international espionage. A former NSA agent, Deirdre is mysterious and beautiful in a cold way. An eccentric who travels via private rail car, she is also extraordinarily persuasive, holding a PhD in forensic psychology that she has put to great use in both her work with the NSA and on her own, as a defender of good, rooting out evil doers and ensuring they are brought to her own brand of justice. Andrea, Riva, and Deirdre all also cast a suspicious eye on the Oakes brothers, Carlton and Jefferson, who run Oakes Industries along with their silent partner and cousin, New Jersey state senator Schuyler Colfax, who also has his eye on the governorâs seat. Oakes Industries has recently made an attempt to purchase Harding Industries, a seemingly irrational move that is rebuffed by Nicholas. What no one knows until much later is that the Oakes brothers have entered into a business deal with Russian mobster Viktor Roman, who represents the real party interested in acquiring Harding Industries, a Vor, Russian organized crime unit, with heavy international interests in the energy sector. Andrea matures quickly as she rapidly learns who she can and cannot trust during her search for the people out to kill her family. Along with her new friends and advocates, she discovers Harding Industries holds a soon to expire option to buy property that could become the source of untold billions from oil reserves, and moves in the nick of time to exercise their right to purchase. But the biggest blow for the Harding family is yet to comeâthe discovery that Viktor Roman has promised Kerry Marcus the governorâs seat in exchange for information about the Hardings, including Nicholas and Michaelâs whereabouts on the night they are shot. Ultimately, Andrea chooses to forego law school and becomes her fatherâs new partner in Harding Industries, no doubt with many adventures yet to come. Masterfully told using a smattering of historical facts along with a soundtrack of classical music masterpieces, this thriller keeps readers on edge until the very end. ...more",andrea harding recent college graduate looking forward attending duke law school world turned upside shooting father nicholas uncle michael surprising puzzling attack family aside paternal grandmother dorothy uncle dies attack father lays comatose andrea harding recent college graduate looking forward attending duke law school world turned upside shooting father nicholas uncle michael surprising puzzling attack family aside paternal grandmother dorothy uncle dies attack father lays comatose icu falls andrea investigate would want kill father uncle also oversee harding industries family company longtime attorney one handful family friends beth cowling rushes help andrea long distance youngest harding soon finds surrounded bevy intriguing new friends helpers first arrive daughter riva acting attorney andrea violently attacked home grew forcing kill assassins lover state prosecutor gubernatorial hopeful kerry marcus equally loss name suspects harding family attacks riva begins investigation short list family friends colleagues including marshall former colleague marshall pharmaceutical runs wife karen marshall shady past including incident company also involved father also looks closely marcus ricci father closest high school friend jason death leukemia ricci becomes like second father andrea ricci also widely believed ties new jersey mob beth another contact wants involved investigation deirdre southington daughter old friend cordelia southington southington family money god well deirdre contacts intriguing world international espionage former nsa agent deirdre mysterious beautiful cold way eccentric travels via private rail car also extraordinarily persuasive holding phd forensic psychology put great use work nsa defender good rooting evil doers ensuring brought brand justice andrea riva deirdre also cast suspicious eye oakes brothers carlton jefferson run oakes industries along silent partner cousin new jersey state senator schuyler colfax also eye seat oakes industries recently made attempt purchase harding industries seemingly irrational move rebuffed nicholas one knows much later oakes brothers entered business deal russian mobster viktor roman represents real party interested acquiring harding industries vor russian organized crime unit heavy international interests energy sector andrea matures quickly rapidly learns trust search people kill family along new friends advocates discovers harding industries holds soon expire option buy property could become source untold billions oil reserves moves nick time exercise right purchase biggest blow harding family yet discovery viktor roman promised kerry marcus seat exchange information hardings including nicholas whereabouts night shot ultimately andrea chooses forego law school becomes new partner harding industries doubt many adventures yet come masterfully told using smattering historical facts along soundtrack classical music masterpieces thriller keeps readers edge end,0.9349

The Most Perfect Thing: Inside (and Outside) a Bird's Egg,"Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of h Renowned ornithologist Tim Birkhead opens this gripping story as a female guillemot chick hatches, already carrying her full quota of tiny eggs within her undeveloped ovary. As she grows into adulthood, only a few of her eggs mature, are released into the oviduct, and are fertilized by sperm stored from copulation that took place days or weeks earlier. Within a matter of hours, the fragile yolk is surrounded by albumen and the whole is gradually encased within a turquoise jewel of a shell. Soon afterward the fully formed egg is expelled onto a bare rocky ledge, where it will be incubated for four weeks before another chick emerges and the life cycle begins again. A Bird's Egg is about how eggs in general are made, fertilized, developed, and hatched. The eggs of most birds spend just 24 hours in the oviduct; however, that journey takes 48 hours in cuckoos, which surreptitiously lay their eggs in the nests of other birds. From the earliest times, the study of birds' ovaries and ova (eggs) played a vital role in the quest to unravel the mysteries of fertilization and embryo development in humans. Birkhead uses birds' eggs as wondrous portals into natural history, enlivened by the stories of naturalists and scientists, including Birkhead and his students, whose discoveries have advanced current scientific knowledge of reproduction. ...more",renowned ornithologist tim birkhead opens gripping story female guillemot chick hatches already carrying full quota tiny eggs within undeveloped ovary grows adulthood eggs mature released oviduct fertilized sperm stored copulation took place days weeks earlier within matter h renowned ornithologist tim birkhead opens gripping story female guillemot chick hatches already carrying full quota tiny eggs within undeveloped ovary grows adulthood eggs mature released oviduct fertilized sperm stored copulation took place days weeks earlier within matter hours fragile yolk surrounded albumen whole gradually encased within turquoise jewel shell soon afterward fully formed egg expelled onto bare rocky ledge incubated four weeks another chick emerges life cycle begins bird egg eggs general made fertilized developed hatched eggs birds spend hours oviduct however journey takes hours cuckoos surreptitiously lay eggs nests birds earliest times study birds ovaries ova eggs played vital role quest unravel mysteries fertilization embryo development humans birkhead uses birds eggs wondrous portals natural history enlivened stories naturalists scientists including birkhead students whose discoveries advanced current scientific knowledge reproduction,0.9207

When his excess fat started causing brain fog and food cravings sapped his energy and willpower, Asprey turned to the same hacking techniques that made his fortune to ""hack"" his own biology, investing more than $300,000 and 15 years to uncover what was hindering his energy, performance, appearance, and happiness. From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime. The result? The Bulletproof Diet, an anti-inflammatory program for hunger-free, rapid weight loss and peak performance.

It was a time of creativity unparalleled in history before or since, from science to the arts, from philosophy to politics. Acclaimed philosopher and historian A.C. Grayling points to three primary factors that led to the rise of vernacular (popular) languages in philosophy, theology, science, and literature; the rise of the individual as a general and not merely an aristocratic type; and the invention and application of instruments and measurement in the study of the natural world.Grayling vividly reconstructs this unprecedented era and breathes new life into the major figures of the seventeenth century intelligentsia who span literature, music, science, art, and philosophy--Shakespeare, Monteverdi, Galileo, Rembrandt, Locke, Newton, Descartes, Vermeer, Hobbes, Milton, and Cervantes, among many more. During this century, a fundamentally new way of perceiving the world emerged as reason rose to prominence over tradition, and the rights of the individual took center stage in philosophy and politics, a paradigmatic shift that would define Western thought for centuries to come. ...more",age genius explores eventful intertwining outward event inner intellectual life tell richness depth story century europe time creativity unparalleled history since science arts philosophy politics acclaimed philosopher historian grayling points three primar age genius explores eventful intertwining outward event inner intellectual life tell richness depth story century europe time creativity unparalleled history since science arts philosophy politics acclaimed philosopher historian grayling points three primary factors led rise vernacular popular languages philosophy theology science literature rise individual general merely aristocratic type invention application instruments measurement study natural vividly reconstructs unprecedented era breathes new life major figures seventeenth century intelligentsia span literature music science art philosophy shakespeare monteverdi galileo rembrandt locke newton descartes vermeer hobbes milton cervantes among many century fundamentally new way perceiving world emerged reason rose prominence tradition rights individual took center stage philosophy politics paradigmatic shift would define western thought centuries come,0.975

Ripping suspense, sheer terror, and a wrenching love story.â âSandra Brown, New York Times bestselling author of FrictionThe terrible truth about Manderley is that someone is always watching. Manderley Resort is a gleaming, new twenty-story hotel on the California coast. Itâs about to open its doors, and the world--at least those with the means to afford it--will be welcomed into a palace of opulence and unparalleled security. But someone is determined that Manderley will never open. The staff has no idea that their every move is being watched, and over the next twelve hours they will be killed off, one by one. Writing in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe and Stephen King, and with a deep bow to Daphne du Maurier, author Gina Wohlsdorf pairs narrative ingenuity and razor-wire prose with quick twists, sharp turns, and gasp-inducing terror.

But we don't have a skilled enough labor pool to fill the positions that will be created, which are in many cases technically demanding and require specialized skills. A decades-long series of idealistic educational policies with the expressed goal of getting every student to go to college has left a generation of potential workers out of the system. Touted as a progressive, egalitarian institution providing opportunity even to those with the greatest need, the American secondary school system has in fact deepened existing inequalities.We can do better, argue acclaimed sociologists Katherine Newman and Hella Winston. Taking a page from the successful experience of countries like Germany and Austria, where youth unemployment is a mere 7%, they call for a radical reevaluation of the idea of vocational training, long discredited as an instrument of tracking. The United States can prepare a new, high-performance labor force if we revamp our school system to value industry apprenticeship and rigorous technical education. By doing so, we will not only be able to meet the growing demand for skilled employees in dozens of sectors where employers decry the absence of well trained workers -- we will make the American Dream accessible to all. ...more",katherine newman author shame game sociologist hella winston sharp irrefutable call reenergize nation system vocational trainingafter decades downsizing left blue collar workers obsolete stranded united states verge industrial renaissance w katherine newman author shame game sociologist hella winston sharp irrefutable call reenergize nation system vocational trainingafter decades downsizing left blue collar workers obsolete stranded united states verge industrial renaissance skilled enough labor pool fill positions created many cases technically demanding require specialized skills series idealistic educational policies expressed goal getting every student go college left generation potential workers system touted progressive egalitarian institution providing opportunity even greatest need american secondary school system fact deepened existing better argue acclaimed sociologists katherine newman hella winston taking page successful experience countries like germany austria youth unemployment mere call radical reevaluation idea vocational training long discredited instrument tracking united states prepare new labor force revamp school system value industry apprenticeship rigorous technical education able meet growing demand skilled employees dozens sectors employers decry absence well trained workers make american dream accessible,0.9201

Dalrymple renders this gang of eccentrics and mystics in a loose but realistic pen and ink style highly dynamic and tailor-made for depicting New York's teeming city streets. He has a flair for the dramatic as well scenes of Sinclair flying, or of a giant walking the streets, are genuinely affecting, while seeming completely natural and brings to life a subtle kind of cartoon surrealism. The story meanders a bit, and it's not always clear where it's headed, but the fun of Pop Gun War is in its vivid characters and details. It is a fine debut, reminiscent of DC Comics's Vertigo line, with which it should sit comfortably on bookstores' and adventurous readers' shelves. ...more",pop gun war childhood oppression guilt dreams loneliness whatever feeling reader get story rather typical narrative wanted get literal inner city boy sinclair discovers pair discarded angel wings wings sinclair flies around city gets pop gun war childhood oppression guilt dreams loneliness whatever feeling reader get story rather typical narrative wanted get literal inner city boy sinclair discovers pair discarded angel wings wings sinclair flies around city gets adventures farel dalrymple series creator publishers weekly collecting first five issues dalrymple acclaimed comic book series pop gun war book provides capsule look dalrymple vision urban fantasy set new york stories follow characters wings talking fish giants dwarves fantastical acquaintances ideas center boy named sinclair acquires set wings tattooed disgruntled angel pays cut sinclair lonely kid prone bowties teased sets series encounters across city older sister singer rock band inspiration worry homeless man unknown powers origins joins band youths pursue dalrymple renders gang eccentrics mystics loose realistic pen ink style highly dynamic depicting new york teeming city streets flair dramatic well scenes sinclair flying giant walking streets genuinely affecting seeming completely natural brings life subtle kind cartoon surrealism story meanders bit always clear headed fun pop gun war vivid characters details fine debut reminiscent dc comics vertigo line sit comfortably bookstores adventurous readers shelves,-0.8595

Metchnikoffâs daring theory of immunityâthat voracious cells he called phagocytes formed the first line of defense against invading bacteriaâwould eventually earn the scientist a Nobel Prize, shared with his archrival, as well as the unofficial m oniker âFather of Natural Immunity.â But first he had to win over skeptics, especially those who called his theory âan oriental fairy tale.â Using previously inaccessible archival materials, author Luba Vikhanski chronicles Metchnikoffâs remarkable life and discoveries in the first moder n biography of this hero of medicine. Metchnikoff was a towering figure in the scientific community of the early twentieth century, a tireless humanitarian who, while working at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, also strived to curb the spread of cholera, syphilis, and other deadly diseases. In his later years, he startled the world with controversial theories on longevity, launching a global craze for yogurt, and pioneered research into gut microbes and aging. Though Metchnikoff was largely forgotten for nearly a hundred years, Vikhanski documents a remarkable revival of interest in his ideas on immunity and on the gut flora in the science of the twenty-first century. ...more",around christmas peering microscope starfish larvae inserted tiny thorns russian zoologist elie metchnikoff brilliant insight mobile cells saw gathering around thorns nothing healing force action daring theory voracious cells called phagocytes formed around christmas peering microscope starfish larvae inserted tiny thorns russian zoologist elie metchnikoff brilliant insight mobile cells saw gathering around thorns nothing healing force action daring theory voracious cells called phagocytes formed first line defense invading eventually earn scientist nobel prize shared archrival well unofficial oniker natural first win skeptics especially called theory oriental fairy using previously inaccessible archival materials author luba vikhanski chronicles remarkable life discoveries first moder n biography hero medicine metchnikoff towering figure scientific community early twentieth century tireless humanitarian working pasteur institute paris also strived curb spread cholera syphilis deadly diseases later years startled world controversial theories longevity launching global craze yogurt pioneered research gut microbes aging though metchnikoff largely forgotten nearly hundred years vikhanski documents remarkable revival interest ideas immunity gut flora science century,0.9878

We feel unqualified to do Godâs work or to live out the calling we imagine. But God has a way of using our weaknesses for good. In fact, God loves unqualified people.In (Un)Qualified, Pastor Steven Furtick helps you peel back the assumptions youâve made about yourself and see yourself as God sees you. Because true peace and confidence come not from worldly perfection but from acceptance: Godâs acceptance of you, your acceptance of yourself, and your acceptance of Godâs process of change.This is a book about understanding your identity in light of who God is. Itâs a book about coming to terms with the good, the bad, and the unmentionable in your life and learning to let God use you. Itâs about charging into the gap between your present and your hopes and meeting God there. After all, God canât bless who you pretend to be. But he longs to bless who you really are; a flawed and broken person. Good thing for us that God is in the business of using broken people to do big things. Being Unqualified Is Godâs Favorite QualificationOur culture tells us that the answer to our failures is to fix them. The solution to our weaknesses is to hide them. The secret to our success is to appear as flawless as possible. But Godâs qualifying system is different than the worldâs. So is his view of our weaknesses, our purpose, and our true selves.In (Un)Qualified, Steven Furtick explores who God is as the great âI AM,â and then helps us discover our own identity. Delving into the story of Jacob, Furtick invites us to acknowledge our weaknesses and ask God to work through them.The truth is, God has created us to be more, to accomplish more, and to love life more than we ever thought possible. But to become who he has called us to be, we must embrace who we are right now. (Un)Qualified equips us to face obstacles and failures without losing a sense of purpose.

And while we desire to shape culture, we are not often aware of how culture shapes us. We might not realize the ways our hearts are being taught to love rival gods instead of the One for whom we were made. Smith helps readers recognize the formative power of culture and the transformative possibilities of Christian practices. He explains that worship is the ""imagination station"" that incubates our loves and longings so that our cultural endeavors are indexed toward God and his kingdom. This is why the church and worshiping in a local community of believers should be the hub and heart of Christian formation and discipleship.Following the publication of his influential work Desiring the Kingdom, Smith received numerous requests from pastors and leaders for a more accessible version of that book's content. No mere abridgment, this new book draws on years of Smith's popular presentations on the ideas presented in Desiring the Kingdom to offer a fresh, bottom-up rearticulation. The author creatively uses film, literature, and music illustrations to engage readers and includes material on marriage, family, youth ministry, and faith and work.

Among them: James Bennett, a synesthetic art critic for The New York Times whose unlikely condition enables him to describe art in profound, magical ways, and Raul Engales, an exiled Argentinian painter running from his past and the Dirty War that has enveloped his country. As the two men ascend in the downtown arts scene, dual tragedies strike, and each is faced with a loss that acutely affects his relationship to life and to art. It is not until they are inadvertently brought together by Lucy Olliasonâa small town beauty and Raulâs museâand a young orphan boy sent mysteriously from Buenos Aires, that James and Raul are able to rediscover some semblance of what theyâve lost.As inventive as Jennifer Egan's A Visit From The Goon Squad and as sweeping as Meg Wolitzer's The Interestings, Tuesday Nights in 1980 boldly renders a complex moment when the meaning and nature of art is being all but upended, and New York City as a whole is reinventing itself.

Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates: The Forgotten War That Changed American History,"From the authors of the New York Times bestseller George Washingtonâs Secret Six ,the little-known story of Thomas Jeffersonâs battle to defend America against Islamic pirates. Brian Kilmeade â cohost of âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News and the national radio show âKilmeade & Friendsâ â returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. From the authors of theÂ  New York Times Â bestsellerÂ  George Washingtonâs Secret Six ,Â the little-known story of Thomas Jeffersonâs battle to defend America against Islamic pirates. Brian Kilmeade â cohost of âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News and the national radio show âKilmeade & Friendsâ â returns with another fascinating historical narrative, co-written with Don Yaeger. Like their acclaimed bestseller George Washington's Secret Six, Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates sheds new light on a vitally important episode that has been forgotten by most Americans. Â  Only weeks after President Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, he decided to confront the Tripoli pirates who had been kidnapping American ships and sailors, among other outrageous acts. Though inclined toward diplomacy, Jefferson sent warships to blockade Tripoli and protect American shipping, and then escalated to all-out war against the Barbary states. Â  The tiny American flotillaâwith three frigates representing half of the U.S. Navyâs top-of-the-line shipsâhad some success in blockading the Barbary coast. But that success came to an end when the USSÂ PhiladelphiaÂ ran aground in Tripoli harbor and was captured. Kilmeade and Yaeger recount the dramatic story of a young American sailor, Stephen Decatur, who snuck into the harbor, boarded theÂ Philadelphia,Â and set her on fire before escaping amid a torrent of enemy gunfire. Â  Another amazing story is that of William Eatonâs daring attack on the port city of Derna. He led a detachment of Marines on a 500-mile trek across the desert to surprise the port. His strategy worked, and an American flag was raised in victory on foreign soil for the first time. Â  Â  Few remember Decatur and Eaton today, but their legacy inspired the opening of theÂ Marine Corps Hymn: âFrom the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli, we fight our countryâs battles in the air, on land, and sea.âÂ Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates tells a dramatic story of bravery, diplomacy, and battle on the high seas, and honors some of Americaâs forgotten heroes.Â  ...more",authors new york times bestseller george secret six story thomas battle defend america islamic pirates brian kilmeade cohost fox news national radio show returns another fascinating historical narrative yaeger authors theâ new york times â bestsellerâ george secret six â story thomas battle defend america islamic pirates brian kilmeade cohost fox news national radio show returns another fascinating historical narrative yaeger like acclaimed bestseller george washington secret six thomas jefferson tripoli pirates sheds new light vitally important episode forgotten americans â weeks president jefferson inauguration decided confront tripoli pirates kidnapping american ships sailors among outrageous acts though inclined toward diplomacy jefferson sent warships blockade tripoli protect american shipping escalated war barbary states â tiny american three frigates representing half success blockading barbary coast success came end ussâ philadelphiaâ ran aground tripoli harbor captured kilmeade yaeger recount dramatic story young american sailor stephen decatur snuck harbor boarded theâ philadelphia â set fire escaping amid torrent enemy gunfire â another amazing story william daring attack port city derna led detachment marines trek across desert surprise port strategy worked american flag raised victory foreign soil first time â â remember decatur eaton today legacy inspired opening theâ marine corps hymn halls montezuma shores tripoli fight battles air land thomas jefferson tripoli pirates tells dramatic story bravery diplomacy battle high seas honors forgotten,0.8316

The Third Wave: An Entrepreneurâs Vision of the Future,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERWALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLEROne of Americaâs most accomplished entrepreneursâa pioneer who made the Internet part of everyday life and orchestrated the largest merger in the history of businessâshares a roadmap for how anyone can succeed in a world of rapidly changing technology.Steve Caseâs career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success, and there were many near-death experiences and back-to-the-wall pivots. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOLâs merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world. In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler (from whom Case has borrowed the title, and whose work inspired him as a young man), Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies. We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the âThird Waveâ of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, weâre entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major âreal worldâ sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and foodâand in the process change the way we live our daily lives. But success in the Third Wave will require a different skill set, and Case outlines the path forward.The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future. With passion and clarity, Case explains the ways in which newly emerging technology companies (a growing number of which, he argues, will not be based in Silicon Valley) will have to rethink their relationships with customers, with competitors, and with governments; and offers advice for how entrepreneurs can make winning business decisions and strategiesâand how all of us can make sense of this changing digital age. ...more",new york times bestsellerwall street journal bestsellerone accomplished pioneer made internet part everyday life orchestrated largest merger history roadmap anyone succeed world rapidly changing career began cofounded america online aol new york times bestsellerwall street journal bestsellerone accomplished pioneer made internet part everyday life orchestrated largest merger history roadmap anyone succeed world rapidly changing career began cofounded america online aol time three percent americans online took decade aol achieve mainstream success many experiences pivots aol became top performing company peak half consumer internet traffic united states ran service case engineered merger time warner became chairman combined business case oversaw biggest media communications empire world third wave pays homage work futurist alvin toffler case borrowed title whose work inspired young man case takes us behind scenes consequential riveting business decisions time offering illuminating insights decades working entrepreneur investor philanthropist advocate sensible bipartisan policies entering case explains new paradigm called internet first wave saw aol companies lay foundation consumers connect internet second wave saw companies like google facebook build top internet create search social networking capabilities apps like snapchat instagram leverage smartphone revolution case argues entering third wave period entrepreneurs vastly transform major sectors like health education transportation energy process change way live daily lives success third wave require different skill set case outlines path third wave part memoir part manifesto part playbook future passion clarity case explains ways newly emerging technology companies growing number argues based silicon valley rethink relationships customers competitors governments offers advice entrepreneurs make winning business decisions us make sense changing digital age,0.9918

To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore's dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn'tâwhich mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore's dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we're realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. The Omnivore's Dilemma is bestselling author Michael Pollan's brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America. Pollan has divided The Omnivore's Dilemma into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or ""organic"" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a mealâat McDonald's, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary ""beyond organic"" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance. We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. The Omnivore's Dilemma is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?A few facts and figures from The Omnivore's Dilemma:Of the 38 ingredients it takes to make a McNugget, there are at least 13 that are derived from corn. 45 different menu items at Mcdonaldâs are made from corn. One in every three American children eats fast food every day. One in every five American meals today is eaten in the car. The food industry burns nearly a fifth of all the petroleum consumed in the United Statesâmore than we burn with our cars and more than any other industry consumes. It takes ten calories of fossil fuel energy to deliver one calorie of food energy to an American plate. A single strawberry contains about five calories. To get that strawberry from a field in California to a plate on the east coast requires 435 calories of energy. Industrial fertilizer and industrial pesticides both owe their existence to the conversion of the World War II munitions industry to civilian usesânerve gases became pesticides, and ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers. ... ...more",dinner one degree another simple question assails creature faced wide choice things eat anthropologists call omnivore dilemma choosing among countless potential foods nature offers humans learn safe mushrooms avoided example berries dinner one degree another simple question assails creature faced wide choice things eat anthropologists call omnivore dilemma choosing among countless potential foods nature offers humans learn safe mushrooms avoided example berries enjoy today america confronts described national eating disorder omnivore dilemma returned atavistic vengeance cornucopia modern american supermarket outlet thrown us back bewildering landscape worry morsels might kill us time realizing food choices also profound implications health environment omnivore dilemma bestselling author michael pollan brilliant exploration vitally important dimensions eating america pollan divided omnivore dilemma three parts one food chains sustain us industrialized food alternative organic food food people obtain dint hunting gathering gardening pollan follows food chain literally ground table emphasizing dynamic coevolutionary relationship species depend concludes section sitting mcdonald home family sharing dinner whole foods revolutionary beyond organic farm virginia meal traces provenance everything consumed revealing hidden components unwittingly ingest explaining taste particular foods reflects environmental biological inheritance indeed eat remakes world society voracious increasingly confused omnivores beginning recognize profound consequences simplest everyday food choices natural world omnivore dilemma book one become known bringing completely fresh perspective question ordinary yet momentous shall dinner facts figures omnivore dilemma ingredients takes make mcnugget least derived corn different menu items made corn one every three american children eats fast food every day one every five american meals today eaten car food industry burns nearly fifth petroleum consumed united burn cars industry consumes takes ten calories fossil fuel energy deliver one calorie food energy american plate single strawberry contains five calories get strawberry field california plate east coast requires calories energy industrial fertilizer industrial pesticides owe existence conversion world war ii munitions industry civilian gases became pesticides ammonium nitrate explosives became nitrogen fertilizers,0.624

The Long Shadow of Small Ghosts: Murder and Memory in an American City,"In Cold Blood meets Adrian Nicole LeBlancâs Random Family: A harrowing, profoundly personal investigation of the causes, effects, and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimeâthe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville, Texas.On March 11, 2003, in Brownsville, Texasâone of Americaâs poorest citiesâJohn Allen Rubio and Angel In Cold Blood meets Adrian Nicole LeBlancâs Random Family: A harrowing, profoundly personal investigation of the causes, effects, and communal toll of a deeply troubling crimeâthe brutal murder of three young children by their parents in the border city of Brownsville, Texas.On March 11, 2003, in Brownsville, Texasâone of Americaâs poorest citiesâJohn Allen Rubio and Angela Camacho murdered their three young children. The apartment building in which the brutal crimes took place was already rundown, and in their aftermath a consensus developed in the community that it should be destroyed. It was a place, neighbors felt, that was plagued by spiritual cancer. In 2008, journalist Laura Tillman covered the story for The Brownsville Herald. The questions it raised haunted her, particularly one asked by the sole member of the cityâs Heritage Council to oppose demolition: is there any such thing as an evil building? Her investigation took her far beyond that question, revealing the nature of the toll that the crime exacted on a city already wracked with poverty. It sprawled into a six-year inquiry into the larger significance of such acts, ones so difficult to imagine or explain that their perpetrators are often dismissed as monsters alien to humanity. With meticulous attention and stunning compassion, Tillman surveyed those surrounding the crimes, speaking with the lawyers who tried the case, the familyâs neighbors and relatives and teachers, even one of the murderers: John Allen Rubio himself, whom she corresponded with for years and ultimately met in person. The result is a brilliant exploration of some of our ageâs most important social issues, from poverty to mental illness to the death penalty, and a beautiful, profound meditation on the truly human forces that drive them. It is disturbing, insightful, and mesmerizing in equal measure. ...more",cold blood meets adrian nicole random family harrowing profoundly personal investigation causes effects communal toll deeply troubling brutal murder three young children parents border city brownsville march brownsville poorest allen rubio angel cold blood meets adrian nicole random family harrowing profoundly personal investigation causes effects communal toll deeply troubling brutal murder three young children parents border city brownsville march brownsville poorest allen rubio angela camacho murdered three young children apartment building brutal crimes took place already rundown aftermath consensus developed community destroyed place neighbors felt plagued spiritual cancer journalist laura tillman covered story brownsville herald questions raised haunted particularly one asked sole member heritage council oppose demolition thing evil building investigation took far beyond question revealing nature toll crime exacted city already wracked poverty sprawled inquiry larger significance acts ones difficult imagine explain perpetrators often dismissed monsters alien humanity meticulous attention stunning compassion tillman surveyed surrounding crimes speaking lawyers tried case neighbors relatives teachers even one murderers john allen rubio corresponded years ultimately met person result brilliant exploration important social issues poverty mental illness death penalty beautiful profound meditation truly human forces drive disturbing insightful mesmerizing equal measure,-0.9971

The Genius of Birds,"Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence. Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InThe Genius of Birds, Birds are astonishingly intelligent creatures. In fact, according to revolutionary new research, some birds rival primates and even humans in their remarkable forms of intelligence.Â  Like humans, many birds have enormous brains relative to their size. Although small, bird brains are packed with neurons that allow them to punch well above their weight. InÂ The Genius of Birds, acclaimed author Jennifer Ackerman explores the newly discovered brilliance of birds and how it came about. As she travels around the world to the most cutting-edge frontiers of researchâ the distant laboratories of Barbados and New Caledonia, the great tit communities of the United Kingdom and the bowerbird habitats of Australia, the ravaged mid-Atlantic coast after Hurricane Sandy and the warming mountains of central Virginia and the western statesâAckerman not only tells the story of the recently uncovered genius of birds but also delves deeply into the latest findings about the bird brain itself that are revolutionizing our view of what it means to be intelligent.Consider, as Ackerman does, the Clarkâs nutcracker, a bird that can hide as many as 30,000 seeds over dozens of square miles and remember where it put them several months later; the mockingbirds and thrashers, species that can store 200 to 2,000 different songs in a brain a thousand times smaller than ours; the well-known pigeon, which knows where itâs going, even thousands of miles from familiar territory; and the New Caledonian crow, an impressive bird that makes its own tools. But beyond highlighting how birds use their unique genius in technical ways, Ackerman points out the impressive social smarts of birds. They deceive and manipulate. They eavesdrop. They display a strong sense of fairness. They give gifts. They play keep-away and tug-of-war. They tease. They share. They cultivate social networks. They vie for status. They kiss to console one another. They teach their young. They blackmail their parents. They alert one another to danger. They summon witnesses to the death of a peer. They may even grieve. This elegant scientific investigation and travelogue weaves personal anecdotes with fascinating science. Ackerman delivers an extraordinary story that will both give readers a new appreciation for the exceptional talents of birds and let them discover what birds can reveal about our changing world. Incredibly informative and beautifully written,Â The Genius of BirdsÂ richly celebrates the triumphs of these surprising and fiercely intelligent creatures. ...more",birds astonishingly intelligent creatures fact according revolutionary new research birds rival primates even humans remarkable forms intelligence like humans many birds enormous brains relative size although small bird brains packed neurons allow punch well weight inthe genius birds birds astonishingly intelligent creatures fact according revolutionary new research birds rival primates even humans remarkable forms like humans many birds enormous brains relative size although small bird brains packed neurons allow punch well weight inâ genius birds acclaimed author jennifer ackerman explores newly discovered brilliance birds came travels around world frontiers distant laboratories barbados new caledonia great tit communities united kingdom bowerbird habitats australia ravaged coast hurricane sandy warming mountains central virginia western tells story recently uncovered genius birds also delves deeply latest findings bird brain revolutionizing view means ackerman nutcracker bird hide many seeds dozens square miles remember put several months later mockingbirds thrashers species store different songs brain thousand times smaller pigeon knows going even thousands miles familiar territory new caledonian crow impressive bird makes tools beyond highlighting birds use unique genius technical ways ackerman points impressive social smarts birds deceive manipulate eavesdrop display strong sense fairness give gifts play tease share cultivate social networks vie status kiss console one another teach young blackmail parents alert one another danger summon witnesses death peer may even grieve elegant scientific investigation travelogue weaves personal anecdotes fascinating science ackerman delivers extraordinary story give readers new appreciation exceptional talents birds let discover birds reveal changing world incredibly informative beautifully written â genius birdsâ richly celebrates triumphs surprising fiercely intelligent creatures,0.9972

T Now a New York Times BestsellerA hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of theÂ pleasures and perils of modern romance from one of this generationâs sharpest comedic voicesAt some point, every one of us embarks on a journey to find love. We meet people, date, getÂ into and out of relationships, all with the hopeÂ of finding someone with whom we share a deepÂ connection. This seems standard now, but itâsÂ wildly different from what people did even justÂ decades ago. Single people today have moreÂ romantic options than at any point in humanÂ history. With technology, our abilities to connectÂ with and sort through these options are staggering.Â So why are so many people frustrated?Some of our problems are unique to our time.Â âWhy did this guy just text me an emoji of a pizza?âÂ âShould I go out with this girl even though sheÂ listed Combos as one of her favorite snack foods?Â Combos?!â âMy girlfriend just got a message fromÂ some dude named Nathan. Whoâs Nathan? Did heÂ just send her a photo of his penis? Should I checkÂ just to be sure?âÂ But the transformation of our romantic livesÂ canât be explained by technology alone. In a shortÂ period of time, the whole culture of finding loveÂ has changed dramatically. A few decades ago,Â people would find a decent person who lived inÂ their neighborhood. Their families would meetÂ and, after deciding neither party seemed like aÂ murderer, they would get married and soon haveÂ a kid, all by the time they were twenty-four. Today,Â people marry later than ever and spend years ofÂ their lives on a quest to find the perfect person, aÂ soul mate.For years, Aziz Ansari has been aiming hisÂ comic insight at modern romance, but for ModernÂ Romance, the book, he decided he needed to takeÂ things to another level. He teamed up with NYUÂ sociologist Eric Klinenberg and designed a massiveÂ research project, including hundreds of interviewsÂ and focus groups conducted everywhere fromÂ Tokyo to Buenos Aires to Wichita. They analyzedÂ behavioral data and surveys and created their ownÂ online research forum on Reddit, which drewÂ thousands of messages. They enlisted the worldâsÂ leading social scientists, including Andrew Cherlin, Eli Finkel, HelenÂ Fisher, Sheena Iyengar, Barry Schwartz, SherryÂ Turkle, and Robb Willer. The result is unlike anyÂ social science or humor book weâve seen before.In Modern Romance, Ansari combines hisÂ irreverent humor with cutting-edge social scienceÂ to give us an unforgettable tour of our newÂ romantic world. ...more",new york times bestsellera hilarious thoughtful exploration thepleasures perils modern romance one sharpest comedic voicesat point every one us embarks journey find love meet people date getinto relationships hopeof finding someone share deepconnection new york times bestsellera hilarious thoughtful exploration theâ pleasures perils modern romance one sharpest comedic voicesat point every one us embarks journey find love meet people date getâ relationships hopeâ finding someone share deepâ connection seems standard wildly different people even justâ decades ago single people today moreâ romantic options point humanâ history technology abilities connectâ sort options many people frustrated problems unique guy text emoji pizza go girl even though sheâ listed combos one favorite snack foods â combos girlfriend got message fromâ dude named nathan nathan heâ send photo penis checkâ sure transformation romantic livesâ explained technology alone shortâ period time whole culture finding loveâ changed dramatically decades ago â people would find decent person lived inâ neighborhood families would meetâ deciding neither party seemed like aâ murderer would get married soon haveâ kid time today â people marry later ever spend years ofâ lives quest find perfect person aâ soul years aziz ansari aiming hisâ comic insight modern romance modernâ romance book decided needed takeâ things another level teamed nyuâ sociologist eric klinenberg designed massiveâ research project including hundreds interviewsâ focus groups conducted everywhere fromâ tokyo buenos aires wichita analyzedâ behavioral data surveys created ownâ online research forum reddit drewâ thousands messages enlisted leading social scientists including andrew cherlin eli finkel helenâ fisher sheena iyengar barry schwartz sherryâ turkle robb willer result unlike anyâ social science humor book seen modern romance ansari combines hisâ irreverent humor social scienceâ give us unforgettable tour newâ romantic world,0.9953

And yet John Quincy fell in love with her, almost despite himself. Their often tempestuous but deeply close marriage lasted half a century.Â  They lived in Prussia, Massachusetts, Washington, Russia, and England, at royal courts, on farms, in cities, and in the White House. Louisa saw more of Europe and America than nearly any other woman of her time. But wherever she lived, she was always pressing her nose against the glass, not quite sure whether she was looking in or out. The other members of the Adams family could take their identity for grantedâthey were Adamses; they were Americansâbut she had to invent her own. The story of Louisa Catherine Adams is one of a woman who forged a sense of self. As the country her husband led found its place in the world, she found a voice. That voice resonates still.Â  In this deeply felt biography, the talented journalist and historian Louisa Thomas finally gives Louisa Catherine Adams's full extraordinary life its due. An intimate portrait of a remarkable woman, a complicated marriage, and a pivotal historical moment, Louisa Thomas's biography is a masterful work from an elegant storyteller. ...more",intimate portrait louisa catherine adams wife john quincy adams witnessed firsthand greatest transformations time born london american father british mother eve revolutionary war louisa catherine johnson raised circumstances different new england upbringing future president john quincy intimate portrait louisa catherine adams wife john quincy adams witnessed firsthand greatest transformations timeâ â â born london american father british mother eve revolutionary war louisa catherine johnson raised circumstances different new england upbringing future president john quincy adams whose life dedicated public service earliest age yet john quincy fell love almost despite often tempestuous deeply close marriage lasted half lived prussia massachusetts washington russia england royal courts farms cities white house louisa saw europe america nearly woman time wherever lived always pressing nose glass quite sure whether looking members adams family could take identity adamses invent story louisa catherine adams one woman forged sense self country husband led found place world found voice voice resonates deeply felt biography talented journalist historian louisa thomas finally gives louisa catherine adams full extraordinary life due intimate portrait remarkable woman complicated marriage pivotal historical moment louisa thomas biography masterful work elegant storyteller,0.9668

For millennia this massif in eastern Turkey has been rumored as the resting place of Noahâs Ark following the Great Flood. But it also plays a significant role in the longstanding conflict between Turkey and Armenia.Author Rick Antonson joined a five-member expedition to the mountainâs nearly 17,000-foot summit, trekking alongside a contingent of Armenians, for whom Mount Ararat is the stolen symbol of their country. Antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote with unexpected travel vignettes, whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts on the peak, recounting the genocide of Armenians and its unresolved debate, or depicting the Kurdsâ ambitions for their own nationâs borders, which some say should include Mount Ararat.What unfolds in Full Moon Over Noahâs Ark is one manâs odyssey, a tale told through many stories. Starting with the flooding of the Black Sea in 5600 BCE, through to the Epic of Gilgamesh and the contrasting narratives of the Great Flood known to followers of the Judaic, Christian and Islamic religions, Full Moon Over Noahâs Ark takes readers along with Antonson through the shadows and broad landscapes of Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Armenia, shedding light on a troubled but fascinating area of the world. ...more",acclaimed travel writer rick antonson sets adventurous compass mount ararat exploring long history religious mysteries complex ararat fabled mountain world millennia massif eastern turkey rumored resting place ark following great flood also plays significant ro acclaimed travel writer rick antonson sets adventurous compass mount ararat exploring long history religious mysteries complex ararat fabled mountain world millennia massif eastern turkey rumored resting place ark following great flood also plays significant role longstanding conflict turkey rick antonson joined expedition nearly summit trekking alongside contingent armenians mount ararat stolen symbol country antonson weaves vivid historical anecdote unexpected travel vignettes whether tracing earlier mountaineering attempts peak recounting genocide armenians unresolved debate depicting ambitions borders say include mount unfolds full moon ark one odyssey tale told many stories starting flooding black sea bce epic gilgamesh contrasting narratives great flood known followers judaic christian islamic religions full moon ark takes readers along antonson shadows broad landscapes turkey iraq iran armenia shedding light troubled fascinating area world,0.9565

And much like the pattern we find in the wild, the ancient serpent will stalk the youngest of the flock because theyâre the easiest target. So Iâm writing these short readings to encourage new Christians during the most vulnerable part of their journey.I want to remind new followers of the âWayâ that the Christian life is best lived in community with others who are striving to follow Jesus. One of our first responsibilities as a new Christian is to spend as much time as possible with others who are being real with their faith. Just as a soldier would never go into battle alone and unarmed, we must remember that though our struggle is not against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12), itâs still a battle. Itâs important to make sure we have other soldiers around us and we are armed with the Sword of the Spirit. (Ephesians 6:17 & Hebrews 4:12)One thing that the enemy will try to do is make you doubt your salvation. The last thing he needs is one more person confident in their relationship with Jesus Christ. As you read through these short devotions hold on to this truth: Salvation was yours the moment you acknowledged your need for a Savior (Romans 3:10-12), repented of your sins (Acts 3:19) and confessed Jesus Christ as your Lord. (Romans 10:9-10) Hopefully, youâll find other truths to hang on to as you move through the pages of this book.So hold on to what you have (Revelation 3:11), hang tight with your âplatoonâ (Hebrews 10:24-25) and use the Sword (Hebrews 4:12 & Ephesians 6:17) youâll find in the following pages for your weapon as the words that accompany the Scripture give you encouragement to stay the course. ...more",enemy devil prowls around like lion peter wants steal kill destroy john much like pattern find wild ancient serpent stalk youngest flock easiest target writing short readings encourage new christians vulnerable part journey enemy devil prowls around like lion peter wants steal kill destroy john much like pattern find wild ancient serpent stalk youngest flock easiest target writing short readings encourage new christians vulnerable part want remind new followers christian life best lived community others striving follow jesus one first responsibilities new christian spend much time possible others real faith soldier would never go battle alone unarmed must remember though struggle flesh blood ephesians still battle important make sure soldiers around us armed sword spirit ephesians hebrews one thing enemy try make doubt salvation last thing needs one person confident relationship jesus christ read short devotions hold truth salvation moment acknowledged need savior romans repented sins acts confessed jesus christ lord romans hopefully find truths hang move pages hold revelation hang tight hebrews use sword hebrews ephesians find following pages weapon words accompany scripture give encouragement stay course,-0.826

The genius is John Rothstein, an iconic author who created a famous character, Jimmy Gold, but who hasnât published a book for decades.

Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us,"Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate peopleâat work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn a Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate peopleâat work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink (author of To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Motivating Others) explains in his paradigm-shattering book Drive, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world.Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business doesâand how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the wrong way to motivate people for today's challenges. In Drive, he reveals the three elements of true motivation:*Autonomyâthe desire to direct our own lives*Masteryâthe urge to get better and better at something that matters*Purposeâthe yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselvesAlong the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward.Drive is bursting with big ideasâthe rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live. ...more",forget everything thought knew motivate work school home wrong daniel pink author sell human surprising truth motivating others explains book drive secret high performance satisfaction today world deeply human need direct lives learn forget everything thought knew motivate work school home wrong daniel pink author sell human surprising truth motivating others explains book drive secret high performance satisfaction today world deeply human need direct lives learn create new things better four decades scientific research human motivation pink exposes mismatch science knows business affects every aspect lives demonstrates approach worked successfully century precisely wrong way motivate people today challenges drive reveals three elements true motivation desire direct lives urge get better better something matters yearning service something larger ourselvesalong way takes us companies enlisting new approaches motivation introduces us scientists entrepreneurs pointing bold way bursting big rare book change think transform live,0.9908

The credit Researcher and thought leader Dr. BrenÃ© Brown offers a powerful new vision that encourages us to dare greatly: to embrace vulnerability and imperfection, to live wholeheartedly, and to courageously engage in our lives. âIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.â âTheodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection.

Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living,"âIâm a person who listens for a living. I listen for wisdom, and beauty, and for voices not shouting to be heard. This book chronicles some of what Iâve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations, across disciplines and denominations.â Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extr âIâm a person who listens for a living.Â  I listen for wisdom, and beauty, and for voices not shouting to be heard.Â  This book chronicles some of what Iâve learned in what has become a conversation across time and generations, across disciplines and denominations.â Â  Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities Medalist Krista Tippett has interviewed the most extraordinary voices examining the great questions of meaning for our time. The heart of her work on her national public radio program and podcast,Â On Being, has been to shine a light on people whose insights kindle in us a sense of wonder and courage. Scientists in a variety of fields; theologians from an array of faiths; poets, activists, and many others have all opened themselves up to Tippett's compassionate yet searching conversation. Â  InÂ Becoming Wise, Tippett distills the insights she has gleaned from this luminous conversation in its many dimensions into a coherent narrative journey, over time and from mind to mind. The book is a master class in living, curated by Tippett and accompanied by a delightfully ecumenical dream team of teaching faculty. Â  The open questions and challenges of our time are intimate and civilizational all at once, Tippett says â definitions of when life begins and when death happens, of the meaning of community and family and identity, of our relationships to technology and through technology. The wisdom we seek emerges through the raw materials of the everyday. And the enduring question of what it means to be human has now become inextricable from the question of who we are to each other. Â  This book offers a grounded and fiercely hopeful vision of humanity for this century â of personal growth but also renewed public life and human spiritual evolution. It insists on the possibility of a common life for this century marked by resilience and redemption, with beauty as a core moral value and civility and love as muscular practice. Krista Tippett's great gift, in her work and in Becoming Wise, is to avoid reductive simplifications but still find the golden threads that weave people and ideas together into a shimmering braid. Â  One powerful common denominator of the lessons imparted to Tippett is the gift of presence, of the exhilaration of engagement with life for its own sake, not as a means to an end. But presence does not mean passivity or acceptance of the status quo. Indeed Tippett and her teachers are people whose work meets, and often drives, powerful forces of change alive in the world today. In the end, perhaps the greatest blessing conveyed by the lessons of spiritual genius Tippett harvests inÂ Becoming WiseÂ is the strength to meet the world where it really is, and then to make it better. ...more",person listens living listen wisdom beauty voices shouting heard book chronicles learned become conversation across time generations across disciplines peabody broadcaster national humanities medalist krista tippett interviewed extr person listens listen wisdom beauty voices shouting book chronicles learned become conversation across time generations across disciplines â peabody broadcaster national humanities medalist krista tippett interviewed extraordinary voices examining great questions meaning time heart work national public radio program podcast â shine light people whose insights kindle us sense wonder courage scientists variety fields theologians array faiths poets activists many others opened tippett compassionate yet searching conversation â inâ becoming wise tippett distills insights gleaned luminous conversation many dimensions coherent narrative journey time mind mind book master class living curated tippett accompanied delightfully ecumenical dream team teaching faculty â open questions challenges time intimate civilizational tippett says definitions life begins death happens meaning community family identity relationships technology technology wisdom seek emerges raw materials everyday enduring question means human become inextricable question â book offers grounded fiercely hopeful vision humanity century personal growth also renewed public life human spiritual evolution insists possibility common life century marked resilience redemption beauty core moral value civility love muscular practice krista tippett great gift work becoming wise avoid reductive simplifications still find golden threads weave people ideas together shimmering braid â one powerful common denominator lessons imparted tippett gift presence exhilaration engagement life sake means end presence mean passivity acceptance status quo indeed tippett teachers people whose work meets often drives powerful forces change alive world today end perhaps greatest blessing conveyed lessons spiritual genius tippett harvests inâ becoming wiseâ strength meet world really make better,0.9984

One in four Americans reject any affiliation with organized religion, and nearly half of those under thirty describe themselves as âspiritual but not religious.â But as the airwaves resound with the haranguing of preachers and pundits, who speaks for the millions who find no joy in whittling the wonder of existence to a simple yes/no choice? Lesley Hazleton does. In this provocative, brilliant book, she gives voice to the case for agnosticism, breaks it free of its stereotypes as watered-down atheism or amorphous âseeking,â and celebrates it as a reasoned, revealing, and sustaining stance toward life. Stepping over the lines imposed by rigid conviction, she draws on philosophy, theology, psychology, science, and more to explore, with curiosity and passion, the vital role of mystery in a deceptively information-rich world; to ask what we mean by the search for meaning; to invoke the humbling yet elating perspective of infinity; to challenge received ideas about death; and to reconsider what âthe soulâ might be. Inspired and inspiring, AgnosticÂ recasts the question of belief not as a problem to be solved but as an invitation to an ongoing, open-ended adventure of the mind. ...more",widely admired writer religion celebrates agnosticism vibrant ultimately toward mysteries existence one four americans reject affiliation organized religion nearly half thirty describe airwaves resound haranguing widely admired writer religion celebrates agnosticism vibrant ultimately toward mysteries existence one four americans reject affiliation organized religion nearly half thirty describe airwaves resound haranguing preachers pundits speaks millions find joy whittling wonder existence simple choice lesley hazleton provocative brilliant book gives voice case agnosticism breaks free stereotypes atheism amorphous celebrates reasoned revealing sustaining stance toward life stepping lines imposed rigid conviction draws philosophy theology psychology science explore curiosity passion vital role mystery deceptively world ask mean search meaning invoke humbling yet elating perspective infinity challenge received ideas death reconsider might inspired inspiring agnosticâ recasts question belief problem solved invitation ongoing adventure mind,0.9893
Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,"From the internationally bestselling author of No god but God comes a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth.Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the âKingdom From the internationally bestselling author of No god but God comes a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth.Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the âKingdom of God.â The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal.Within decades after his shameful death, his followers would call him God.Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of historyâs most influential and enigmatic characters by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived: first-century Palestine, an age awash in apocalyptic fervor. Scores of Jewish prophets, preachers, and would-be messiahs wandered through the Holy Land, bearing messages from God. This was the age of zealotryâa fervent nationalism that made resistance to the Roman occupation a sacred duty incumbent on all Jews. And few figures better exemplified this principle than the charismatic Galilean who defied both the imperial authorities and their allies in the Jewish religious hierarchy.Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction; a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves with swords; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity a secret; and ultimately the seditious âKing of the Jewsâ whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his brief lifetime. Aslan explores the reasons why the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus of Nazarethâs life and mission. The result is a thought-provoking, elegantly written biography with the pulse of a fast-paced novel: a singularly brilliant portrait of a man, a time, and the birth of a religion. ...more",internationally bestselling author god god comes fascinating provocative meticulously researched biography challenges assumptions man know jesus thousand years ago itinerant jewish preacher miracle worker walked across galilee gathering followers establish called internationally bestselling author god god comes fascinating provocative meticulously researched biography challenges assumptions man know jesus thousand years ago itinerant jewish preacher miracle worker walked across galilee gathering followers establish called revolutionary movement launched threatening established order captured tortured executed state decades shameful death followers would call centuries mythmaking reza aslan sheds new light one influential enigmatic characters examining jesus lens tumultuous era lived palestine age awash apocalyptic fervor scores jewish prophets preachers messiahs wandered holy land bearing messages god age fervent nationalism made resistance roman occupation sacred duty incumbent jews figures better exemplified principle charismatic galilean defied imperial authorities allies jewish religious jesus gospels historical sources aslan describes man full conviction passion yet rife contradiction man peace exhorted followers arm swords exorcist faith healer urged disciples keep identity secret ultimately seditious whose promise liberation rome went unfulfilled brief lifetime aslan explores reasons early christian church preferred promulgate image jesus peaceful spiritual teacher rather politically conscious revolutionary grapples riddle jesus understood mystery heart subsequent claims yields fresh perspective one greatest stories ever told even affirms radical transformative nature jesus life mission result elegantly written biography pulse novel singularly brilliant portrait man time birth religion,0.9903

Why the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism--From Goldwater to the Tea Party and Beyond,"âDionne's expertise is evident in this finely crafted and convincing work.â âThe Los Angeles TimesFrom one of our most engaging political reporters and the author of Why Americans Hate Politics; the story of conservatism from the Goldwater 1960s to the present day Tea Party that has resulted in broken promises and an ideological purity that drives moderate Republicans away âDionne's expertise is evident in this finely crafted and convincing work.â âThe Los Angeles TimesFrom one of our most engaging political reporters and the author of Why Americans Hate Politics; the story of conservatism from the Goldwater 1960s to the present day Tea Party that has resulted in broken promises and an ideological purity that drives moderate Republicans away.Why the Right Went Wrong offers a historical view of the right since the 1960s. Its core contention is that American conservatism and the Republican Party took a wrong turn when they adopted Barry Goldwaterâs worldview during and after the 1964 campaign. The radicalism of todayâs conservatism is not the product of the Tea Party, Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne writes. The Tea Partiers are the true heirs to Goldwater ideology. The purity movement did more than drive moderates out of the Republican Partyâit beat back alternative definitions of conservatism.Since 1968, no conservative administrationânot Nixon not Reagan not two Bushesâcould live up to the rhetoric rooted in the Goldwater movement that began to reshape American politics fifty years ago. The collapse of the Nixon presidency led to the rise of Ronald Reagan, the defeat of George H.W. Bush, to Newt Gingrichâs revolution. Bush initially undertook a partial modernization, preaching âcompassionate conservatismâ and a âFourth Wayâ to Clintonâs âThird Way.â Conservatives quickly defined him as an advocate of âbig governmentâ and not conservative enough on spending, immigration, education, and Medicare. A return to the true faith was the only prescription on order. The result was the Tea Party, which Dionne says, was as much a reaction to Bush as to Obama.The state of the Republican party, controlled by the strictest base, is diminished, Dionne writes. It has become white and older in a country that is no longer that. It needs to come back to life for its own health and that of the countryâs, and in Why the Right Went Wrong, he explains how. ...more",expertise evident finely crafted convincing los angeles timesfrom one engaging political reporters author americans hate politics story conservatism goldwater present day tea party resulted broken promises ideological purity drives moderate republicans away expertise evident finely crafted convincing los angeles timesfrom one engaging political reporters author americans hate politics story conservatism goldwater present day tea party resulted broken promises ideological purity drives moderate republicans right went wrong offers historical view right since core contention american conservatism republican party took wrong turn adopted barry worldview campaign radicalism conservatism product tea party washington post columnist dionne writes tea partiers true heirs goldwater ideology purity movement drive moderates republican beat back alternative definitions conservative nixon reagan two live rhetoric rooted goldwater movement began reshape american politics fifty years ago collapse nixon presidency led rise ronald reagan defeat george bush newt revolution bush initially undertook partial modernization preaching conservatives quickly defined advocate conservative enough spending immigration education medicare return true faith prescription order result tea party dionne says much reaction bush state republican party controlled strictest base diminished dionne writes become white older country longer needs come back life health right went wrong explains,0.8225

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the planeâs bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenantâs name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, heâd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a manâs journey into extremity, Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit. ...more",may afternoon army air forces bomber crashed pacific ocean disappeared leaving spray debris slick oil gasoline blood ocean surface face appeared young lieutenant bombardier struggling life raft pulling aboard began one extraordin may afternoon army air forces bomber crashed pacific ocean disappeared leaving spray debris slick oil gasoline blood ocean surface face appeared young lieutenant bombardier struggling life raft pulling aboard began one extraordinary odysseys second world name louis zamperini boyhood cunning incorrigible delinquent breaking houses brawling fleeing home ride rails teenager channeled defiance running discovering prodigious talent carried berlin olympics within sight mile war come athlete become airman embarking journey led doomed flight tiny raft drift zamperini lay thousands miles open ocean leaping sharks foundering raft thirst starvation enemy aircraft beyond trial even greater driven limits endurance zamperini would answer desperation ingenuity suffering hope resolve humor brutality rebellion fate whether triumph tragedy would suspended fraying wire new book laura hillenbrand writes rich vivid narrative voice displayed seabiscuit telling unforgettable story journey extremity unbroken testament resilience human mind body spirit,-0.9618

This is a stunning book of electric honesty and passion. Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill.At first they thought it was flu, then pneumonia, then complete septic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later - the night before New Year's Eve - the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and fatal coronary.In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma.This powerful book is Didion's 'attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness, about marriage and children and memory, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself'. The result is an exploration of an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage, and a life, in good times and bad. ...more",one america iconic writers portrait marriage life good times bad speak anyone ever loved husband wife child stunning book electric honesty passion several days christmas john gregory dunne joan didion saw daughter quintana fall first thought one america iconic writers portrait marriage life good times bad speak anyone ever loved husband wife child stunning book electric honesty passion several days christmas john gregory dunne joan didion saw daughter quintana fall first thought flu pneumonia complete septic shock put induced coma placed life support days later night new year eve dunnes sitting dinner visiting hospital john suffered massive fatal second close symbiotic partnership years four weeks later daughter pulled two months arriving la airport collapsed underwent six hours brain surgery ucla medical centre relieve massive powerful book didion make sense weeks months cut loose fixed idea ever death illness marriage children memory shallowness sanity life result exploration intensely personal yet universal experience portrait marriage life good times bad,0.8176

But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty, supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading.When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked being killed.In this thrilling book, master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them. ...more",winner pulitzer prize david mccullough tells dramatic courageous brothers taught world fly wilbur orville winter day outer banks north carolina two unknown brothers ohio changed history would take world time believe happened age winner pulitzer prize david mccullough tells dramatic courageous brothers taught world fly wilbur orville winter day outer banks north carolina two unknown brothers ohio changed history would take world time believe happened age flight begun first powered machine carrying men achieved david mccullough winner pulitzer prize tells surprising profoundly american story wilbur orville couple unschooled dayton bicycle mechanics happened hit success men exceptional courage determination intellectual interests ceaseless curiosity much attributed upbringing house lived electricity indoor plumbing books aplenty supplied mainly preacher father never stopped worked together problem seemed insurmountable wilbur unquestionably genius orville mechanical ingenuity ever seen public high school education little money contacts high places never stopped mission take air nothing even reality every time took one contrivances risked thrilling book master historian david mccullough draws immense riches wright papers including private diaries notebooks scrapbooks thousand letters private family correspondence tell human side wright brothers story including contributions sister katharine without things might well gone differently,0.9937

She has no interest in collaborating with the authors of the Gospelâher keepers, who provide her with food and shelter and visit her regularly. She does not agree that her son is the Son of God; nor that his death was âworth it;â nor that the âgroup of misfits he gathered around him, men who could not look a woman in the eye,â were holy disciples. Mary judges herself ruthlessly (she did not stay at the foot of the Cross until her son diedâshe fled, to save herself), and is equally harsh on her judgment of others.

She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.Â Marketers at Procter & Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible patternâand with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.Â An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employeesâhow they approach worker safetyâand soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.Â What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. Â They succeeded by transforming habits.Â In The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. Â Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter & Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warrenâs Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nationâs largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.Â At its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. Â Habits arenât destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. ...more",young woman walks laboratory past two years transformed almost every aspect life quit smoking run marathon promoted work patterns inside brain neurologists discover fundamentally procter gamble study videos people making beds desperately trying figur young woman walks laboratory past two years transformed almost every aspect life quit smoking run marathon promoted work patterns inside brain neurologists discover fundamentally marketers procter gamble study videos people making beds desperately trying figure sell new product called febreze track one biggest flops company history suddenly one detects nearly imperceptible slight shift advertising febreze goes earn billion dollars untested ceo takes one largest companies america first order business attacking single pattern among approach worker soon firm alcoa becomes top performer dow people common achieved success focusing patterns shape every aspect lives â succeeded transforming power habit new york times business reporter charles duhigg takes us thrilling edge scientific discoveries explain habits exist changed penetrating intelligence ability distill vast amounts information engrossing narratives duhigg brings life whole new understanding human nature potential transformation â along way learn people companies struggle change despite years trying others seem remake overnight visit laboratories neuroscientists explore habits work exactly reside brains discover right habits crucial success olympic swimmer michael phelps starbucks ceo howard schultz hero martin luther king go inside procter gamble target superstores rick saddleback church nfl locker rooms largest hospitals see implementing keystone habits earn billions mean difference failure success life core power habit contains exhilarating argument key exercising regularly losing weight raising exceptional children becoming productive building revolutionary companies social movements achieving success understanding habits work â habits destiny charles duhigg shows harnessing new science transform businesses communities lives,0.9612

Here, for the first time and in detail, Zimbardo tells the full story of the Stanford Prison Experiment, the landmark study in which a group of college-student volunteers was randomly divided into âguardsâ and âinmatesâ and then placed in a mock prison environment. Within a week, the study was abandoned, as ordinary college students were transformed into either brutal, sadistic guards or emotionally broken prisoners. By illuminating the psychological causes behind such disturbing metamorphoses, Zimbardo enables us to better understand a variety of harrowing phenomena, from corporate malfeasance to organized genocide to how once upstanding American soldiers came to abuse and torture Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib. He replaces the long-held notion of the âbad appleâ with that of the âbad barrelââthe idea that the social setting and the system contaminate the individual, rather than the other way around. ...more",renowned social psychologist creator stanford prison experiment philip zimbardo explores mechanisms make good people bad things moral people seduced acting immorally says line separating good lucifer effect explains myriad reasons susceptible lure dar renowned social psychologist creator stanford prison experiment philip zimbardo explores mechanisms make good people bad things moral people seduced acting immorally says line separating good lucifer effect explains myriad reasons susceptible lure dark drawing examples history well trailblazing research zimbardo details situational forces group dynamics work concert make monsters decent men women first time detail zimbardo tells full story stanford prison experiment landmark study group volunteers randomly divided placed mock prison environment within week study abandoned ordinary college students transformed either brutal sadistic guards emotionally broken prisoners illuminating psychological causes behind disturbing metamorphoses zimbardo enables us better understand variety harrowing phenomena corporate malfeasance organized genocide upstanding american soldiers came abuse torture iraqi detainees abu ghraib replaces notion idea social setting system contaminate individual rather way around,-0.9913

He infiltrates the most hostile countries in the world, defeats our enemies' advanced security measures, and eliminates threats before they ever reach our shores. But now, his skills have left him. Sent overseas on a critical assignment, he fails, unable to pull the trigger. Absent his talents, Robie is a man without a mission, and without a purpose.To recover what he has lost, Robie must confront what he has tried to forget for over twenty years: his own past. THE GUILTY Will Robie escaped his small Gulf Coast hometown of Cantrell, Mississippi after high school, severing all personal ties, and never looked back. Not once. Not until the unimaginable occurs. His father, Dan Robie, has been arrested and charged with murder.Father and son haven't spoken or seen each other since the day Robie left town. In that time, Dan Robie - a local attorney and pillar of the community-has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed.To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty?With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism . . . and violence.Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son.

The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu tells the incredible story of how Haidara, a mild-mannered archivist and historian from the legendary city of Timbuktu, later became one of the worldâs greatest and most brazen smugglers.In 2012, thousands of Al Qaeda militants from northwest Africa seized control of most of Mali, including Timbuktu. They imposed Sharia law, chopped off the hands of accused thieves, stoned to death unmarried couples, and threatened to destroy the great manuscripts. As the militants tightened their control over Timbuktu, Haidara organized a dangerous operation to sneak all 350,000 volumes out of the city to the safety of southern Mali.Over the past twenty years, journalist Joshua Hammer visited Timbuktu numerous times and is uniquely qualified to tell the story of Haidaraâs heroic and ultimately successful effort to outwit Al Qaeda and preserve Maliâsâand the worldâsâliterary patrimony. Hammer explores the cityâs manuscript heritage and offers never-before-reported details about the militantsâ march into northwest Africa.

She has spent a frugal, useful, and wholly restrained life in Ashville, a small town in Rhode Island. Overlooked especially by the industries of fashion and media, Mrs. Brown is one of todayâs silent generations of women whose quiet no-frills existences would make them seem invisible.

Meanwhile, people with important ideasâbusiness people, teachers, politicians, journalists, and othersâstruggle to make their ideas âstick.â Why do some ideas thrive while others die? And how do we improve the chances of worthy ideas? In Made to Stick, accomplished educators and idea collectors Chip and Dan Heath tackle head-on these vexing questions.

Fusing hip-hop, pop, R&B, and the best traditions of theater, this once-in-a-generation show broadens the sound of Broadway, reveals the storytelling power of rap, and claims our country's origins for a diverse new generation.HAMILTON: THE REVOLUTION gives readers an unprecedented view of both revolutions, from the only two writers able to provide it. Miranda, along with Jeremy McCarter, a cultural critic and theater artist who was involved in the project from its earliest stages--""since before this was even a show,"" according to Miranda--traces its development from an improbable perforÂ­mance at the White House to its landmark opening night on Broadway six years later. In addition, Miranda has written more than 200 funny, revealing footnotes for his award-winning libretto, the full text of which is published here.Their account features photos by the renowned Frank Ockenfels and veteran Broadway photographer, Joan Marcus; exclusive looks at notebooks and emails; interviews with Questlove, Stephen SondÂ­heim, leading political commentators, and more than 50 people involved with the production; and multiple appearances by PresiÂ­dent Obama himself. The book does more than tell the surprising story of how a Broadway musical became a national phenomenon: It demonstrates that America has always been renewed by the brash upstarts and brilliant outsiders, the men and women who don't throw away their shot. ...more",miranda groundbreaking musical hamilton revolutionary subject poor kid caribbean fought british defended constitution helped found united states fusing pop r b best traditions theater show broadens sound broadway reveals storytelling power r miranda groundbreaking musical hamilton revolutionary subject poor kid caribbean fought british defended constitution helped found united states fusing pop r b best traditions theater show broadens sound broadway reveals storytelling power rap claims country origins diverse new revolution gives readers unprecedented view revolutions two writers able provide miranda along jeremy mccarter cultural critic theater artist involved project earliest stages since even show according miranda traces development improbable white house landmark opening night broadway six years later addition miranda written funny revealing footnotes libretto full text published account features photos renowned frank ockenfels veteran broadway photographer joan marcus exclusive looks notebooks emails interviews questlove stephen leading political commentators people involved production multiple appearances obama book tell surprising story broadway musical became national phenomenon demonstrates america always renewed brash upstarts brilliant outsiders men women throw away shot,0.9136

Cell, the king of horror's homage to zombie films (the book is dedicated in part to George A. Romero) is his goriest, most horrific novel in years, not to mention the most intensely paced. Casting aside his love of elaborate character and town histories and penchant for delayed gratification, King yanks readers off their feet within the first few pages; dragging them into the fray and offering no chance catch their breath until the very last page. In Cell King taps into readers fears of technological warfare and terrorism. Mobile phones deliver the apocalypse to millions of unsuspecting humans by wiping their brains of any humanity, leaving only aggressive and destructive impulses behind. Those without cell phones, like illustrator Clayton Riddell and his small band of ""normies,"" must fight for survival, and their journey to find Clayton's estranged wife and young son rockets the book toward resolution. Fans that have followed King from the beginning will recognize and appreciate Cell as a departure--King's writing has not been so pure of heart and free of hang-ups in years (wrapping up his phenomenal Dark Tower series and receiving a medal from the National Book Foundation doesn't hurt either). ""Retirement"" clearly suits King, and lucky for us, having nothing left to prove frees him up to write frenzied, juiced-up horror-thrillers like Cell.

Advertising no longer works. Weaned on TiVo, the Internet, and other emerging technologies, the short-attention-span generation has become immune to marketing. Consumers are âin control.â Or so weâre told.In Buying In, New York Times Magazine âConsumedâ columnist Rob Walker argues that this accepted wisdom misses a much more important and lasting cultural shift. As technology has created avenues for advertising anywhere and everywhere, people are embracing brands more than ever beforeâcreating brands of their own and participating in marketing campaigns for their favorite brands in unprecedented ways. Increasingly, motivated consumers are pitching in to spread the gospel virally, whether by creating Internet video ads for Converse All Stars or becoming word-of-mouth âagentsâ touting products to friends and family on behalf of huge corporations. In the process, theyâweâhave begun to funnel cultural, political, and community activities through connections with brands. Walker explores this changing cultural landscapeâincluding a practice he calls âmurketing,â blending the terms murky and marketingâby introducing us to the creative marketers, entrepreneurs, artists, and community organizers who have found a way to thrive within it. Using profiles of brands old and new, including Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products, not just as consumer choices, but as conscious expressions of their identities. Part marketing primer, part work of cultural anthropology, Buying In reveals why now, more than ever, we are what we buyâand vice versa. Praise for Buying In âWalker â¦ makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. â¦ [He] leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. â¦ Convincing.â â Jay Dixit, The Washington Post âWalker lays out his theory in well-written, entertaining detail.â â Seth Stevenson, Slate âBuying In delves into the attitudes of the global consumer in the age of plenty, and, well, we arenât too pretty. Walker carries the reader on a frenetically paced tour of senseless consumption spanning from Viking ranges to custom high-tops.â â Robert Blinn, Core77 âRob Walker is one smart shopper.â â Jen Trolio, ReadyMade âThe most trenchant psychoanalyst of our consumer selves is Rob Walker. This is a fresh and fascinating exploration of the places where material culture and identity intersect.â âMichael Pollan, author of In Defense of Food âThis book has vast social implications, far beyond the fields of marketing and branding. It obliterates our old paradigm of companies (the bad guys) corrupting our children (the innocents) via commercials. In this new world, media-literate young people freely and willingly co-opt the brands, and most companies are clueless bystanders desperate to keep up. I really don't know if this is good news or bad news, but I can say, with certainty, that this book is a must-read.ââPo Bronson, author of What Should I Do with My Life? âRob Walker is a gift. He shows that in our shattered, scattered world, powerful brands are existential, insinuating themselves into the human questions âWhat am I about?â and âHow do I connect?â His insight that brand influence is becoming both more pervasive and more hiddenâthat we are not so self-defined as we like to thinkâshould make us disturbed, and vigilant.ââJim Collins, author of Good to GreatâRob Walker is a terrific writerÂ who understands both human nature and the business world. His book is highly entertaining, but itâs also a deeply thoughtful look at the ways in which marketing meets the modern psyche.ââBethany McLean, editor at large, Fortune, and co-author of The Smartest Guys in the RoomâAre we living in an era of YouTube-empowered, brand-rejecting consumers? Rob Walker has the surprising answers, and you wonât want to miss this joyride through the front lines of consumer culture. A marketing must-read.ââChip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick âRob Walker brilliantly deconstructs the religion of consumption.

The latchkey child of a busy single mother, heâs grown up to be a resentful slacker whose idea of high culture is getting stoned and admiring the graffiti in the alley where he scores his weed.

No one was more stunned by this unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief, Ruth Reichl, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled to process what had seemed unthinkable, Reichl turned to the one place that had always provided sanctuary. âI did what I always do when Iâm confused, lonely, or frightened,â she writes. âI disappeared into the kitchen.âMy Kitchen Year follows the change of seasonsâand Reichlâs emotionsâas she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While working 24/7, Reichl would âthrow quick meals togetherâ for her family and friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her. Imagine kale, leaves dark and inviting, sautÃ©ed with chiles and garlic; summer peaches baked into a simple cobbler; fresh oysters chilling in a box of snow; plump chickens and earthy mushrooms, fricasseed with cream. Over the course of this challenging year, each dish Reichl prepares becomes a kind of stepping stone to finding joy again in ordinary things. The 136 recipes collected here represent a lifeâs passion for food: a blistering ma po tofu that shakes Reichl out of the blues; a decadent grilled cheese sandwich that accompanies a rare sighting in the woods around her home; a rhubarb sundae that signals the arrival of spring.

Second Officer Herbert Stone, in charge of the midnight watch on the SS Californian sitting idly a few miles north, saw the distress rockets that the Titanic fired. He alerted the captain, Stanley Lord, who was sleeping in the chartroom below, but Lord did not come to the bridge. Eight rockets were fired during the dark hours of the midnight watch, and eight rockets were ignored. The next morning, the Titanic was at the bottom of the sea and more than 1,500 people were dead. When they learned of the extent of the tragedy, Lord and Stone did everything they could to hide their role in the disaster, but pursued by newspapermen, lawyers, and political leaders in America and England, their terrible secret was eventually revealed.

How do we live, if we're not intimately engaged with another human being? How do we connect with other people? Does technology draw us closer together or trap us behind screens?When Olivia Laing moved to New York City in her mid-thirties, she found herself inhabiting loneliness on a daily basis. Increasingly fascinated by this most shameful of experiences, she began to explore the lonely city by way of art. Moving fluidly between works and lives - from Edward Hopper's Nighthawks to Andy Warhol's Time Capsules, from Henry Darger's hoarding to the depredations of the AIDS crisis - Laing conducts an electric, dazzling investigation into what it means to be alone, illuminating not only the causes of loneliness but also how it might be resisted and redeemed.Humane, provocative and deeply moving, The Lonely City is about the spaces between people and the things that draw them together, about sexuality, mortality and the magical possibilities of art. It's a celebration of a strange and lovely state, adrift from the larger continent of human experience, but intrinsic to the very act of being alive. ...more",expertly crafted work reportage memoir biography subject loneliness told lives iconic artists acclaimed author trip echo spring mean lonely live intimately engaged another human connect people technology draw us closer together trap us expertly crafted work reportage memoir biography subject loneliness told lives iconic artists acclaimed author trip echo spring mean lonely live intimately engaged another human connect people technology draw us closer together trap us behind screens olivia laing moved new york city found inhabiting loneliness daily basis increasingly fascinated shameful experiences began explore lonely city way art moving fluidly works lives edward hopper nighthawks andy warhol time capsules henry darger hoarding depredations aids crisis laing conducts electric dazzling investigation means alone illuminating causes loneliness also might resisted provocative deeply moving lonely city spaces people things draw together sexuality mortality magical possibilities art celebration strange lovely state adrift larger continent human experience intrinsic act alive,-0.96

What if the real threat to the American Dream isnât rising income inequalityâbut an all-out war on success?In Equal is Unfair, a timely and thought-provoking work, Don Watkins and Yaron Brook reveal that almost everything weâve been taught about inequality is wrong. Youâll discover:â¢ why successful CEOs make so much moneyâand deserve toâ¢ how the minimum wage hurts the very people it claims to helpâ¢ why middle-class stagnation is a mythâ¢ how the little-known history of Sweden reveals the dangers of forced equalityâ¢ the disturbing philosophy behind Obamaâs economic agenda.The critics of inequality are right about one thing: the American Dream is under attack.

She hears escape.Once in France, April quickly learns the apartment is not merely some rich hoarder's repository. Beneath the cobwebs and stale perfumed air is a goldmine, and not because of the actual gold (or painted ostrich eggs or mounted rhinoceros horns or bronze bathtub). First, there's a portrait by one of the masters of the Belle Epoque, Giovanni Boldini. And then there are letters and journals written by the very woman in the painting, Marthe deÂ Florian. These documentsÂ reveal that she was more than a renowned courtesan with enviable decolletage. Suddenly April's quest is no longer about the bureaux plats and Louis-style armchairs that will fetch millions at auction.

As she digs into Marthe's life, April can't help but take a deeper look into her own.

That willingness to speak her mind, stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost.That was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former King of Queens star opens up about that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church and its controversial practices.Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress and advancing Scientologyâs causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success sheâd worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientologyâs most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes.But when she began to raise questions about some of the churchâs actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a âSuppressive Person,â and as a result, all of her fellow parishionersâincluding members of her own familyâwere told to disconnect from her. Forever.Bold, brash, and bravely confessional, Troublemaker chronicles Leah Reminiâs remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom, both for herself and for her family.

As a political powerhouse in late 14th century Europe, a time of war, social unrest and one of the worst natural disasters of all time--the plague, she worked for peace between Christians while campaigning for a holy crusade against Muslims. She was illiterate but grew into a great writer by dictating to assistants. She was frail and punished herself mercilessly, often starving herself, while offering moral guidance and inspiration to kings, queens and popes.It's easy to see why feminists through the years have sought to claim the patronage of St. Catherine. From her refusal to marry to her assertion that her physical appearance was of no importance, the famous Saint is ripe for modern interpretation. She was a peacemaker during Siena's revolution of 1368, sometimes addressing thousands of people in squares and streets; she convinced Pope Gregory XI to return the papacy to Rome at a time when the Catholic Church was unraveling.How did this girl, the second-youngest of 25 children of a middle-class dyer, grow to become one of the most beloved spiritual figures of all time, a theological giant to rank alongside the likes of Thomas Aquinas?

And for almost all of those years she has been the secret lover to Paul Sheringham, the scion of the estate next door. On an unseasonably warm March afternoon, Jane and Paul will make love for the last time--though not, as Jane believes, because Paul is about to be married--and the events of the day will alter Jane's life forever. As the narrative moves back and forth from 1924 to the end of the century, what we know and understand about Jane--about the way she loves, thinks, feels, sees, remembers--deepens with every beautifully wrought moment. Her story is one of profound self-discovery and through her, Graham Swift has created an emotionally soaring and deeply affecting work of fiction. ...more",booker award winner luminous profoundly moving work fiction begins afternoon tryst servant girl young man neighboring house opens reveal whole life remarkable year old jane fairchild orphaned birth worked maid one english country estate since sixtee booker award winner luminous profoundly moving work fiction begins afternoon tryst servant girl young man neighboring house opens reveal whole life remarkable year old jane fairchild orphaned birth worked maid one english country estate since sixteen almost years secret lover paul sheringham scion estate next door unseasonably warm march afternoon jane paul make love last time though jane believes paul married events day alter jane life forever narrative moves back forth end century know understand jane way loves thinks feels sees remembers deepens every beautifully wrought moment story one profound graham swift created emotionally soaring deeply affecting work fiction,0.9916

It begins in the tiny Greenwich Village cafÃ© where Smith goes every morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. We then travel, through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations: from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud, and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation, alongside signature memories including her life in Michigan with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic Smith, whose untimely death was an irremediable loss. For it is loss, as well as the consolation we might salvage from it, that lies at the heart of this exquisitely told memoir, one augmented by stunning black-and-white Polaroids taken by Smith herself.

It Didn't Start with You: How Inherited Family Trauma Shapes Who We Are and How to End the Cycle,"A groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations, by an acclaimed expert in the field Depression. Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brainsâbut in the lives of our A groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations, by an acclaimed expert in the field Â Depression. Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brainsâbut in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long intuitedâthat traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. It Didnât Start with You builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score. Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died, or the story has been forgotten or silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood. Â  As a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty years. It Didnât Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization, active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming life and health. It Didnât Start With You is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding difficulties that in many cases, traditional therapy, drugs, or other interventions have not had the capacity to touch. ...more",groundbreaking approach transforming traumatic legacies passed families generations acclaimed expert field depression anxiety chronic pain phobias obsessive thoughts evidence compelling roots difficulties may reside immediate life experience chemical imbalances lives groundbreaking approach transforming traumatic legacies passed families generations acclaimed expert field â depression anxiety chronic pain phobias obsessive thoughts evidence compelling roots difficulties may reside immediate life experience chemical imbalances lives parents grandparents even latest scientific research making headlines supports many long traumatic experience passed generations start builds work leading experts stress including mount sinai school medicine neuroscientist rachel yehuda psychiatrist bessel van der kolk author body keeps score even person suffered original trauma died story forgotten silenced memory feelings live emotional legacies often hidden encoded everything gene expression everyday language play far greater role emotional physical health ever understood â pioneer field inherited family trauma mark wolynn worked individuals groups therapeutic level twenty years start offers pragmatic prescriptive guide method core language approach diagnostic provide way uncover fears anxieties conveyed everyday words behaviors physical symptoms techniques developing genogram extended family tree create map experiences going back generations visualization active imagination direct dialogue create pathways reconnection integration reclaiming life health start transformative approach resolving longstanding difficulties many cases traditional therapy drugs interventions capacity touch,-0.9907

Her s From the winner of 2014âs PEN Robert W. Bingham Prize, an unforgettable debut novel about Loretta, a teenager married off as a âsister wife,â who makes a break for freedomÂ At the heart of this exciting debut novel, set in Arizona and Idaho in the mid-1970s, is fifteen-year-old Loretta, who slips out of her bedroom every evening to meet her so-called gentile boyfriend. Her strict Mormon parents catch her returning one night, and promptly marry her off to Dean Harder, a devout yet materialistic fundamentalist who already has a wife and a brood of kids. The Harders relocate to his native Idaho, where Deanâs teenage nephew Jason falls hard for Loretta. A Zeppelin and Tolkien fan, Jason worships Evel Knievel and longs to leave his close-minded community. He and Loretta make a break for it. They drive all night, stay in hotels, and relish their dizzying burst of teenage freedom as they seek to recover Deanâs cache of âMormon gold.â But someone Loretta left behind is on their trail...Â A riveting story of desire and escape, Daredevils boasts memorable set pieces and a rich cast of secondary characters. Thereâs Deanâs other wife, Ruth, who as a child in the 1950s was separated from her parents during the notorious Short Creek raid, when federal agents descended on a Mormon fundamentalist community. Thereâs Jasonâs best friend, Boyd, part Native American and caught up in the activist spirit of the time, who comes along for the ride, with disastrous results. And Vestalâs ultimate creation is a superbly sleazy chatterboxâa man who might or might not be Evel Knievel himselfâwho works his charms on Loretta at a casino in Elko, Nevada.A lifelong journalist whose Spokesman column is a fixture in Spokane, WA, Shawn has honed his fiction over many years, publishing in journals like McSweeney's and Tin House. His stunning first collection, Godforsaken Idaho, burrowed into history as it engaged with masculinity and crime, faith and apostasy, and the West that he knows so well. Daredevils shows what he can do on a broader canvas--a fascinating, wide-angle portrait of a time and place that's both a classic coming of age tale and a plunge into the myths of America, sacred and profane. ...more",winner pen robert bingham prize unforgettable debut novel loretta teenager married wife makes break freedomat heart exciting debut novel set arizona idaho loretta slips bedroom every evening meet gentile boyfriend winner pen robert bingham prize unforgettable debut novel loretta teenager married wife makes break freedomâ heart exciting debut novel set arizona idaho loretta slips bedroom every evening meet gentile boyfriend strict mormon parents catch returning one night promptly marry dean harder devout yet materialistic fundamentalist already wife brood kids harders relocate native idaho teenage nephew jason falls hard loretta zeppelin tolkien fan jason worships evel knievel longs leave community loretta make break drive night stay hotels relish dizzying burst teenage freedom seek recover cache someone loretta left behind trail â riveting story desire escape daredevils boasts memorable set pieces rich cast secondary characters wife ruth child separated parents notorious short creek raid federal agents descended mormon fundamentalist community best friend boyd part native american caught activist spirit time comes along ride disastrous results ultimate creation superbly sleazy man might might evel knievel works charms loretta casino elko lifelong journalist whose spokesman column fixture spokane wa shawn honed fiction many years publishing journals like mcsweeney tin house stunning first collection godforsaken idaho burrowed history engaged masculinity crime faith apostasy west knows well daredevils shows broader canvas fascinating portrait time place classic coming age tale plunge myths america sacred profane,0.9968

It is a record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the Americas and contains, as does the Bible, the fullness of the everlasting gospel.The book was written by many ancient prophets by the spirit of prophecy and revelation. Their words, written on gold plates, were quoted and abridged by a prophet-historian named Mormon. The record gives an account of two great civilizations. One came from Jerusalem in 600 B.C., and afterward separated into two nations, known as the Nephites and the Lamanites. The other came much earlier when the Lord confounded the tongues at the Tower of Babel. This group is known as the Jaredites. After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are among the ancestors of the American Indians. The crowning event recorded in the Book of Mormon is the personal ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ among the Nephites soon after his resurrection. It puts forth the doctrines of the gospel, outlines the plan of salvation, and tells men what they must do to gain peace in this life and eternal salvation in the life to come. After Mormon completed his writings, he delivered the account to his son Moroni, who added a few words of his own and hid up the plates in the hill Cumorah. On September 21, 1823, the same Moroni, then a glorified, resurrected being, appeared to the Prophet Joseph Smith and instructed him relative to the ancient record and its destined translation into the English language. In due course the plates were delivered to Joseph Smith, who translated them by the gift and power of God. The record is now published in many languages as a new and additional witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and that all who will come unto him and obey the laws and ordinances of his gospel may be saved. Concerning this record the Prophet Joseph Smith said: ""I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book."" In addition to Joseph Smith, the Lord provided for eleven others to see the gold plates for themselves and to be special witnesses of the truth and divinity of the Book of Mormon. Their written testimonies are included herewith as ""The Testimony of Three Witnesses"" and ""The Testimony of Eight Witnesses."" We invite all men everywhere to read the Book of Mormon, to ponder in their hearts the message it contains, and the to ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ if the book is true. Those who pursue this course and ask in faith will gain a testimony of its truth and divinity by the power of the Holy Ghost.

However, if there is a recurring theme in Modern Day Fables it is that of the eternal conflict between the individual and society, between the unique and the formulaic. Each story, or fable, looks at the issue from a different angle, and does so specifically within the context of the current way of thinking in the world.â¢ The bookâs first story, Screen, takes place in the near future where a technological innovation allows for the majority of life to be lived inside a virtual world. As life in the real world becomes more and more scarce, and a strange illness starts spreading throughout the population, a young woman named Misha finds herself drawn deep into the true nature of a sinister company called SciTech.â¢ In The IV Club, a new extracurricular group forms at Glenwood High. Led by a charismatic teacher, it promises relief from suffering through the recognition that we are all innocent victims. While it catches on like wildfire throughout the school and beyond, one studentâs skepticism leads her to uncover what the aim of the club really is.â¢ A young man who has recently graduated college finds himself struggling with where to go in his life in the story, Precipice. After Jake ends up aimlessly walking the campus of his old university one night with a friend, what starts as a nostalgic trip down memory lane quickly turns into a nightmare. A mysterious ally, hostile pursuers, and some suddenly not-so-familiar faces lead him to the verge of a decision that will decide his fate.Within these stories, as well as the rest in the book, you will see the ideals and expectations of society destroy some characters, as well as be exploited by others for power. But most importantly you will find those rare individuals who discover the courage inherent within them to stand apart from the status quo. They are not fearless heroes, but normal everyday people, conflicted yet confident, fearful yet bold. It is within these characters that lessons of the fables lie. ...more",difficult accurately summarize eleven different stories stands alone however recurring theme modern day fables eternal conflict individual society unique formulaic story fable looks issue different angle specifically within contex difficult accurately summarize eleven different stories stands alone however recurring theme modern day fables eternal conflict individual society unique formulaic story fable looks issue different angle specifically within context current way thinking first story screen takes place near future technological innovation allows majority life lived inside virtual world life real world becomes scarce strange illness starts spreading throughout population young woman named misha finds drawn deep true nature sinister company called iv club new extracurricular group forms glenwood high led charismatic teacher promises relief suffering recognition innocent victims catches like wildfire throughout school beyond one skepticism leads uncover aim club really young man recently graduated college finds struggling go life story precipice jake ends aimlessly walking campus old university one night friend starts nostalgic trip memory lane quickly turns nightmare mysterious ally hostile pursuers suddenly faces lead verge decision decide stories well rest book see ideals expectations society destroy characters well exploited others power importantly find rare individuals discover courage inherent within stand apart status quo fearless heroes normal everyday people conflicted yet confident fearful yet bold within characters lessons fables lie,-0.0589

They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the If I Gave You Godâs Phone Numberâ¦ - Survey reveals people's relationships with their CreatorWhat do a Cherokee Medicine Woman, a Death Row inmate, an Afghani Sufi Mystic, a Catholic, a Jew, several praying kids, and Mare Cromwell have in common? They all feel strongly about who or what they think God is, why things happen the way they do, and what will become of us in the future. They question, praise and criticize God in the hopes of better understanding themselves and others. In a world challenged by economic issues, climate change, war, and constant threat of terrorism, people are pausing from their daily routines to ask the deeper questions and wonder about the divine and mysterious nature of their Creator.In this book, author and spiritual seeker Mare Cromwell interviews people from all walks of life, asking, âIf I gave you Godâs phone number, what would you do with it?â This spiritual memoir, framed by twenty-one interviews with people from all walks of life, combines the oral tradition of Studs Terkel with the soulful searchings of Neale Donald Welsh. If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦ offers the reader what only the best books offerâwindows into the most authentic reaches of the soul. Cromwellâs conscientious selection of interview subjects, and her deft questioning, which presses them to go deeper and deeper, is what lends the book its striking range. This diorama of spiritual posturesâsome passionate, some highly intellectualizedâis impossible to look away from, infects the reader with a fever of curiosity about the human condition, and then proceeds to administer the careful cure: vivid, compelling testimony. Not only do her many subjects nourish the reader by their telling, but Cromwell too provides ongoing doses of self-revelation, a gesture of honesty that unifies and strengthens the whole picture. Reading If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦. will enrich your view of spiritual lifeâin all its radiant varietyâforever.What people are saying about If I gave you Godâs phone numberâ¦""I strongly recommend this engaging, thought-provoking book. It is distinguished by Ms. Cromwell's empathy for the interesting and diverse people she searched out to interview about their communication with God. Readers will be stimulated to reflect on their own spiritual journey as well as the author's own experiences and those of the people she has interviewed. Because of Ms. Cromwell's personal candor and insights, I continue to ponder the central question she asked her interviewees in this important and unusual book."" âJames Crowfoot, Ph.D., Professor and Dean Emeritus, University of Michigan and former President of Antioch CollegeâMare Cromwell has done a wonderful job of bringing people's personal views on God and spirituality to the public in this book. These stories will deepen our understanding of the diversity of spirituality in the human experience.ââGarrett Sarley, President of the Omega Institute, author of ""The Essentials of Yoga"" and ""Walking Yoga""ABOUT THE AUTHOR: Mare Cromwell is an author, poet, gardener and environmentalist.

For all practical purposes making art can be examined in great detail without ever getting entangled in the very remote problems of genius.""â-from the IntroductionArt & Fear explores the way art gets made, the reasons it often doesn't get made, and the nature of the difficulties that cause so many artists to give up along the way. The book's co-authors, David Bayles and Ted Orland, are themselves both working artists, grappling daily with the problems of making art in the real world. Their insights and observations, drawn from personal experience, provide an incisive view into the world of art as it is expeienced by artmakers themselves.This is not your typical self-help book. This is a book written by artists, for artists -â it's about what it feels like when artists sit down at their easel or keyboard, in their studio or performance space, trying to do the work they need to do.

In Zero to One , legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if weâre too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin wonât make a search engine. Tomorrowâs champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in todayâs marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique. Zero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places. ...more",want build better future must believe great secret time still uncharted frontiers explore new inventions create zero one legendary entrepreneur investor peter thiel shows find singular ways create new things thiel begins contrarian premise live age want build better future must believe great secret time still uncharted frontiers explore new inventions create zero one legendary entrepreneur investor peter thiel shows find singular ways create new things thiel begins contrarian premise live age technological stagnation even distracted shiny mobile devices notice information technology improved rapidly reason progress limited computers silicon valley progress achieved industry area business comes important skill every leader must master learning think someone else already knows takes world n adding something familiar something new go next bill gates build operating system next larry page sergey brin make search engine champions win competing ruthlessly marketplace escape competition altogether businesses unique zero one presents optimistic view future progress america new way thinking innovation starts learning ask questions lead find value unexpected places,0.9924

The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry (Harold Fry #1),"Harold Fry is convinced that he must deliver a letter to an old friend in order to save her, meeting various characters along the way and reminiscing about the events of his past and people he has known, as he tries to find peace and acceptance.Recently retired, sweet, emotionally numb Harold Fry is jolted out of his passivity by a letter from Queenie Hennessy, an old frie Harold Fry is convinced that he must deliver a letter to an old friend in order to save her, meeting various characters along the way and reminiscing about the events of his past and people he has known, as he tries to find peace and acceptance.Recently retired, sweet, emotionally numb Harold Fry is jolted out of his passivity by a letter from Queenie Hennessy, an old friend, who he hasn't heard from in twenty years. She has written to say she is in hospice and wanted to say goodbye. Leaving his tense, bitter wife Maureen to her chores, Harold intends a quick walk to the corner mailbox to post his reply but instead, inspired by a chance encounter, he becomes convinced he must deliver his message in person to Queenie--who is 600 miles away--because as long as he keeps walking, Harold believes that Queenie will not die. So without hiking boots, rain gear, map or cell phone, one of the most endearing characters in current fiction begins his unlikely pilgrimage across the English countryside. Along the way, strangers stir up memories--flashbacks, often painful, from when his marriage was filled with promise and then not, of his inadequacy as a father, and of his shortcomings as a husband. Ironically, his wife Maureen, shocked by her husband's sudden absence, begins to long for his presence. Is it possible for Harold and Maureen to bridge the distance between them? And will Queenie be alive to see Harold arrive at her door? ...more",harold fry convinced must deliver letter old friend order save meeting various characters along way reminiscing events past people known tries find peace retired sweet emotionally numb harold fry jolted passivity letter queenie hennessy old frie harold fry convinced must deliver letter old friend order save meeting various characters along way reminiscing events past people known tries find peace retired sweet emotionally numb harold fry jolted passivity letter queenie hennessy old friend heard twenty years written say hospice wanted say goodbye leaving tense bitter wife maureen chores harold intends quick walk corner mailbox post reply instead inspired chance encounter becomes convinced must deliver message person queenie miles away long keeps walking harold believes queenie die without hiking boots rain gear map cell phone one endearing characters current fiction begins unlikely pilgrimage across english countryside along way strangers stir memories flashbacks often painful marriage filled promise inadequacy father shortcomings husband ironically wife maureen shocked husband sudden absence begins long presence possible harold maureen bridge distance queenie alive see harold arrive door,0.9761

But beginning in December 1884, Austin was terrorized by someone equally as vicious and, in some ways, far more diabolical than London's infamous Jack the Ripper. For almost exactly one year, the Midnight Assassin crisscrossed the entire city, striking on moonlit nights, using axes, knives, and long steel rods to rip apart women from every race and class. At the time the concept of a serial killer was unthinkable, but the murders continued, the killer became more brazen, and the citizens' panic reached a fever pitch.Before it was all over, at least a dozen men would be arrested in connection with the murders, and the crimes would expose what a newspaper described as ""the most extensive and profound scandal ever known in Austin."" And yes, when Jack the Ripper began his attacks in 1888, London police investigators did wonder if the killer from Austin had crossed the ocean to terrorize their own city.With vivid historical detail and novelistic flair, Texas Monthly journalist Skip Hollandsworth brings this terrifying saga to life. ...more",sweeping narrative history terrifying serial killer america first stalked austin texas late city austin texas cusp emerging isolated western outpost truly cosmopolitan metropolis beginning december austin terrorized someone equally vicious ways far diabolica sweeping narrative history terrifying serial killer america first stalked austin texas late city austin texas cusp emerging isolated western outpost truly cosmopolitan metropolis beginning december austin terrorized someone equally vicious ways far diabolical london infamous jack ripper almost exactly one year midnight assassin crisscrossed entire city striking moonlit nights using axes knives long steel rods rip apart women every race class time concept serial killer unthinkable murders continued killer became brazen citizens panic reached fever least dozen men would arrested connection murders crimes would expose newspaper described extensive profound scandal ever known austin yes jack ripper began attacks london police investigators wonder killer austin crossed ocean terrorize vivid historical detail novelistic flair texas monthly journalist skip hollandsworth brings terrifying saga life,-0.9968

Man's Search for Meaning,"Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945, Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering, but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose. Frankl's theory--known as logotherapy, from the Greek word logos (""meaning"")--holds that our primary drive in life is not pleasure, as Freud maintained, but the discovery and pursuit of what we personally find meaningful.At the time of Frankl's death in 1997, Man's Search for Meaning had sold more than 10 million copies in twenty-four languages. A 1991 reader survey for the Library of Congress that asked readers to name a ""book that made a difference in your life"" found Man's Search for Meaning among the ten most influential books in America. ...more",psychiatrist viktor frankl memoir riveted generations readers descriptions life nazi death camps lessons spiritual survival frankl labored four different camps including auschwitz parents brother pregnant wife perished based experience experiences others treated later psychiatrist viktor frankl memoir riveted generations readers descriptions life nazi death camps lessons spiritual survival frankl labored four different camps including auschwitz parents brother pregnant wife perished based experience experiences others treated later practice frankl argues avoid suffering choose cope find meaning move forward renewed purpose frankl theory known logotherapy greek word logos meaning holds primary drive life pleasure freud maintained discovery pursuit personally find time frankl death man search meaning sold million copies languages reader survey library congress asked readers name book made difference life found man search meaning among ten influential books america,-0.9186

Kill 'Em and Leave: Searching for James Brown and the American Soul,"National Book Award winner James McBride goes in search of the ârealâ James Brown after receiving a tip that promises to uncover the man behind the myth. His surprising journey illuminates not only our understanding of this immensely troubled, misunderstood, and complicated soul genius but the ways in which our cultural heritage has been shaped by Brownâs legacy. Kill âEm National Book Award winner James McBride goes in search of the ârealâ James Brown after receiving a tip that promises to uncover the man behind the myth. His surprising journey illuminates not only our understanding of this immensely troubled, misunderstood, and complicated soul genius but the ways in which our cultural heritage has been shaped by Brownâs legacy. Â Kill âEm and Leave is more than a book about James Brown. Brownâs rough-and-tumble life, through McBrideâs lens, is an unsettling metaphor for American life: the tension between North and South, black and white, rich and poor. McBrideâs travels take him to forgotten corners of Brownâs never-before-revealed history: the country town where Brownâs family and thousands of others were displaced by Americaâs largest nuclear power bomb-making facility; a South Carolina field where a long-forgotten cousin recounts, in the dead of night, a fuller history of Brownâs sharecropping childhood, which until now has been a mystery. McBride seeks out the American expatriate in England who co-created the James Brown sound, visits the trusted right-hand manager who worked with Brown for forty-one years, and interviews Brownâs most influential nonmusical creation, his âadopted son,â the Reverend Al Sharpton. He describes the stirring visit of Michael Jackson to the Augusta, Georgia, funeral home where the King of Pop sat up all night with the body of his musical godfather, spends hours talking with Brownâs first wife, and lays bare the Dickensian legal contest over James Brownâs estate, a fight that has consumed careers; prevented any money from reaching the poor schoolchildren in Georgia and South Carolina, as instructed in his will; cost Brownâs estate millions in legal fees; and left James Brownâs body to lie for more than eight years in a gilded coffin in his daughterâs yard in South Carolina. Â  James McBride is one of the most distinctive and electric literary voices in America today, andÂ part of the pleasure of his narrative is being in his presence, coming to understand Brown through McBrideâs own insights as a black musician with Southern roots.Â Kill âEm and Leave is a song unearthing and celebrating James Brownâs great legacy: the cultural landscape of America today.Praise for Kill âEm and Leave âThe definitive look at one of the greatest, most important entertainers, The Godfather, Da Number One Soul Brother, Mr. Please, Please HimselfâJAMES BROWN.ââSpike Lee âPlease, please, please: Can anybody tell us who and what was James Brown?

John Vassos: Industrial Design for Modern Life,"What should a television look like? How should a dial on a radio feel to the touch? These were questions John Vassos asked when the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) asked him to design the first mass-produced television receiver, the TRK-12, which had its spectacular premier at the 1939 New York Worldâs Fair. Vassos emigrated from Greece and arrived in the United States What should a television look like? How should a dial on a radio feel to the touch? These were questions John Vassos asked when the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) asked him to design the first mass-produced television receiver, the TRK-12, which had its spectacular premier at the 1939 New York Worldâs Fair. Vassos emigrated from Greece and arrived in the United States in 1918. His career spans the evolution of central forms of mass media in the twentieth century and offers a template for understanding their success. This is Vassosâs legacyâshaping the way we interact with our media technologies. Other industrial designers may be more celebrated, but none were more focused on making radio and television attractive and accessible to millions of Americans.In John Vassos: Industrial Design for Modern Life, Danielle Shapiro is the first to examine the life and work of RCAâs key consultant designer through the rise of radio and television and into the computer era. Vassos conceived a vision for the look of new technologies still with us today. A founder of the Industrial Designers Society of America, he was instrumental in the development of a self-conscious industrial design profession during the late 1920s and 1930s and into the postwar period. Drawing on unpublished records and correspondence, Shapiro creates a portrait of a designer whose early artistic work in books like Phobia and Contempo critiqued the commercialization of modern life but whose later design work sought to accommodate it.Replete with rich behind-the-product stories of Americaâs design culture in the 1930s through the 1950s, this volume also chronicles the emergence of what was to become the nationâs largest media company and provides a fascinating glimpse into its early corporate culture. In our current era of watching TV on an iPod or a smartphone, Shapiro stimulates broad discussions of the meaning of technological design for mass media in daily life. ...more",television look like dial radio feel touch questions john vassos asked radio corporation america rca asked design first television receiver spectacular premier new york fair vassos emigrated greece arrived united states television look like dial radio feel touch questions john vassos asked radio corporation america rca asked design first television receiver spectacular premier new york fair vassos emigrated greece arrived united states career spans evolution central forms mass media twentieth century offers template understanding success way interact media technologies industrial designers may celebrated none focused making radio television attractive accessible millions john vassos industrial design modern life danielle shapiro first examine life work key consultant designer rise radio television computer era vassos conceived vision look new technologies still us today founder industrial designers society america instrumental development industrial design profession late postwar period drawing unpublished records correspondence shapiro creates portrait designer whose early artistic work books like phobia contempo critiqued commercialization modern life whose later design work sought accommodate rich stories design culture volume also chronicles emergence become largest media company provides fascinating glimpse early corporate culture current era watching tv ipod smartphone shapiro stimulates broad discussions meaning technological design mass media daily life,0.9866

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.~from author's web site ...more",andrew ender wiggin thinks playing computer simulated war games fact engaged something far desperate result genetic experimentation ender may military genius earth desperately needs war alien enemy seeking destroy human life way find throw ender ever harsher training chip awa andrew ender wiggin thinks playing computer simulated war games fact engaged something far desperate result genetic experimentation ender may military genius earth desperately needs war alien enemy seeking destroy human life way find throw ender ever harsher training chip away find diamond inside destroy utterly ender wiggin six years old begins grow ender result experiment war buggers raging hundred years quest perfect general underway almost long ender two older siblings peter valentine every bit unusual different ways peter uncontrollably violent valentine nearly lacks capability violence altogether neither found suitable military purpose driven jealousy ender inbred drive power peter seeks control political process become ruler valentine abilities turn toward subtle control beliefs commoner elite alike powerfully convincing essays hiding youth identities behind anonymity computer networks two begin working together shape destiny earth future brother ender author web site,-0.9948

The sheer number of citizen scientists, combined with new technology, has begun to shape how research is conducted. Non-professionals become acknowledged experts: dentists turn into astronomers and accountants into botanists.Diary of a Citizen Scientist is a timely exploration of this phenomenon, told through the lens of nature writer Sharman Apt Russellâs yearlong study of a little-known species, the Western red-bellied tiger beetle. In a voice both humorous and lyrical, Russell recounts her persistent and joyful tracking of an insect she calls âcharismatic,â âelegant,â and âfierce.â Patrolling the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico, collectorâs net in hand, she negotiates the realities of climate change even as she celebrates the beauty of a still-wild and rural landscape.Russellâs self-awarenessâof her occasionally-misplaced confidence, her quest to fill in âthat blank spot on the map of tiger beetles,â and her desire to become newly engaged in her lifeâcreates a portrait not only of the tiger beetle she tracks, but of the mindset behind self-driven scientific inquiry. Falling in love with the diversity of citizen science, she participates in crowdsourcing programs that range from cataloguing galaxies to monitoring the phenology of native plants, applauds the growing role of citizen science in environmental activism, and marvels at the profusion of projects around the world.Diary of a Citizen Scientist offers its readers a glimpse into the transformative properties of citizen scienceâand documents the transformation of the field as a whole. ...more",exploding world citizen science hundreds thousands volunteers monitoring climate change tracking bird migration finding stardust nasa excavating mastodons sheer number citizen scientists combined new technology begun shape research conducted become acknowledged experts dentists turn astro exploding world citizen science hundreds thousands volunteers monitoring climate change tracking bird migration finding stardust nasa excavating mastodons sheer number citizen scientists combined new technology begun shape research conducted become acknowledged experts dentists turn astronomers accountants citizen scientist timely exploration phenomenon told lens nature writer sharman apt yearlong study species western tiger beetle voice humorous lyrical russell recounts persistent joyful tracking insect calls patrolling gila river southwestern new mexico net hand negotiates realities climate change even celebrates beauty rural confidence quest fill blank spot map tiger beetles desire become newly engaged portrait tiger beetle tracks mindset behind scientific inquiry falling love diversity citizen science participates crowdsourcing programs range cataloguing galaxies monitoring phenology native plants applauds growing role citizen science environmental activism marvels profusion projects around citizen scientist offers readers glimpse transformative properties citizen documents transformation field whole,0.9892

Beginning with ""Boston Light,""Americaâs first lighthouse, Dolin shows how the story of America, from colony to Set against the backdrop of an expanding nation,Â Brilliant BeaconsÂ traces the evolution of America's lighthouse system from its earliest days, highlighting the political, military, and technological battles fought to illuminate the nation's hardscrabble coastlines. Beginning with ""Boston Light,""Â Americaâs first lighthouse, Dolin shows how the story of America, from colony to regional backwater, toÂ fledging nation, and eventually to global industrial power, can be illustrated through its lighthouses.Even in the colonial era, the question of how best to solve the collective problem of lighting our ports, reefs, and coasts through a patchwork of private interests and independent localities telegraphed the great American debate over federalism and the role of a centralized government. As the nation expanded, throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so too did the coastlines in need of illumination, from New England to the Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes, the Pacific Coast all the way to Alaska. In Dolin's hands we see how each of these beacons tell itsÂ own story of political squabbling, technological advancement, engineering marvel, and individual derring-do.In rollicking detail, Dolin treats readers to a memorable cast of characters, from the penny-pinching Treasury official Stephen Pleasonton, who hamstrung the country's efforts to adopt the revolutionary Fresnel lens, to the indomitableÂ Katherine Walker, who presided so heroically over New York HarborÂ as keeper at Robbins Reef LighthouseÂ that she was hailed as a genuine New York City folk hero upon her death in 1931. He also animates American military history from the Revolution to the Civil War andÂ presentsÂ tales both humorous and harrowing of soldiers, saboteurs, Civil War battles, ruthless egg collectors, and, most important, the lighthouseÂ keepers themselves, men and women who often performed astonishing acts of heroism in carrying outÂ their duties.In the modern world of GPS and satellite-monitored shipping lanes, Brilliant Beacons forms a poignant elegy for the bygone days of the lighthouse, a symbol of American ingenuity that served as both a warning and a sign of hope for generations of mariners; and it also shows how these sentinels have endured, retaining their vibrancy to the present day. Containing over 150 photographs and illustrations, Brilliant BeaconsÂ vividly reframes America's history. ...more",set backdrop expanding nation brilliant beaconstraces evolution america lighthouse system earliest days highlighting political military technological battles fought illuminate nation hardscrabble coastlines beginning boston light first lighthouse dolin shows story america colony set backdrop expanding nation â brilliant beaconsâ traces evolution america lighthouse system earliest days highlighting political military technological battles fought illuminate nation hardscrabble coastlines beginning boston light â first lighthouse dolin shows story america colony regional backwater toâ fledging nation eventually global industrial power illustrated colonial era question best solve collective problem lighting ports reefs coasts patchwork private interests independent localities telegraphed great american debate federalism role centralized government nation expanded throughout nineteenth early twentieth centuries coastlines need illumination new england gulf mexico great lakes pacific coast way alaska dolin hands see beacons tell itsâ story political squabbling technological advancement engineering marvel individual rollicking detail dolin treats readers memorable cast characters treasury official stephen pleasonton hamstrung country efforts adopt revolutionary fresnel lens indomitableâ katherine walker presided heroically new york harborâ keeper robbins reef lighthouseâ hailed genuine new york city folk hero upon death also animates american military history revolution civil war andâ presentsâ tales humorous harrowing soldiers saboteurs civil war battles ruthless egg collectors important lighthouseâ keepers men women often performed astonishing acts heroism carrying outâ modern world gps shipping lanes brilliant beacons forms poignant elegy bygone days lighthouse symbol american ingenuity served warning sign hope generations mariners also shows sentinels endured retaining vibrancy present day containing photographs illustrations brilliant beaconsâ vividly reframes america history,0.9808

A âThis is your country, this is your world, this is your body, and you must find some way to live within the all of it.âIn a profound work that pivots from the biggest questions about American history and ideals to the most intimate concerns of a father for his son, Ta-Nehisi Coates offers a powerful new framework for understanding our nationâs history and current crisis. Americans have built an empire on the idea of ârace,â a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and menâbodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden? Â Between the World and Me is Ta-Nehisi Coatesâs attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his sonâand readersâthe story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose childrenâs lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, Between the World and Me clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward. ...more",country world body must find way live within profound work pivots biggest questions american history ideals intimate concerns father son coates offers powerful new framework understanding history current crisis country world body must find way live within profound work pivots biggest questions american history ideals intimate concerns father son coates offers powerful new framework understanding history current crisis americans built empire idea falsehood damages us falls heavily bodies black women exploited slavery segregation today threatened locked murdered proportion like inhabit black body find way live within honestly reckon fraught history free burden â world attempt answer questions letter adolescent son coates shares story awakening truth place world series revelatory experiences howard university civil war battlefields south side chicago paris childhood home living rooms mothers whose lives taken american plunder beautifully woven personal narrative reimagined history fresh emotionally charged reportage world clearly illuminates past bracingly confronts present offers transcendent vision way forward,-0.8591

O. Green Junior High in Oxnard, CA, 14-year-old Brandon McInerney shot and killed his classmate, Larry King, who had recently begun to call himself ""Leticia"" and wear makeup and jewelry to school.Profoundly shaken by the news, and unsettled by media coverage that sidestepped the issues of gender identity and of race integral to the case, psychologist Ken Corbett traveled to LA to attend the trial. As visions of victim and perpetrator were woven and unwoven in the theater of the courtroom, a haunting picture emerged not only of the two young teenagers, but also of spectators altered by an atrocity and of a community that had unwittingly gestated a murder. Drawing on firsthand observations, extensive interviews and research, as well as on his decades of academic work on gender and sexuality, Corbett holds each murky facet of this case up to the light, exploring the fault lines of memory and the lacunae of uncertainty behind facts.

Lauded as the most articulate voice of American freedom and equality, even as he held peopleâincluding his own familyâin bondage, Jefferson is variably described as a hypocrite, an atheist, or a simple-minded proponent of limited government who expected all Americans to be farmers forever.Now, Annette Gordon-Reed teams up with America's leading Jefferson scholar, Peter S. Onuf, to present an absorbing and revealing character study that dispels the many clichÃ©s that have accrued over the years about our third president. Challenging the widely prevalent belief that Jefferson remains so opaque as to be unknowable, the authorsâthrough their careful analysis, painstaking research, and vivid proseâcreate a portrait of Jefferson, as he might have painted himself, one ""comprised of equal parts sun and shadow"" (Jane Kamensky).Tracing Jefferson's philosophical development from youth to old age, the authors explore what they call the ""empire"" of Jefferson's imaginationâan expansive state of mind born of his origins in a slave society, his intellectual influences, and the vaulting ambition that propelled him into public life as a modern avatar of the Enlightenment who, at the same time, likened himself to a figure of oldâ""the most blessed of the patriarchs."" Indeed, Jefferson saw himself as a ""patriarch,"" not just to his country and mountain-like home at Monticello but also to his family, the white half that he loved so publicly, as well as to the black side that he claimed to love, a contradiction of extraordinary historical magnitude.Divided into three sections, ""Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"" reveals a striking personal dimension to his life. Part I,Â ""Patriarch,"" explores Jeffersons's origins in Virgina; Part II, "" 'Traveller,' "" covers his five-year sojourn to Paris; and Part III, ""Enthusiast,"" delves insightfully into the Virginian's views on Christianity, slavery, and race. We see not just his ideas and vision of America but come to know him in an almost familial way, such as through the importance of music in his life.""Most Blessed of the Patriarchs"" fundamentally challenges much of what weâve come to accept about Jefferson, neither hypocrite nor saint, atheist nor fundamentalist. Gordon-Reed and Onuf, through a close reading of Jeffersonâs own words, reintroduce us all to our most influential founding father: a man more gifted than most, but complicated in just the ways we all are. ...more",thomas jefferson often portrayed hopelessly enigmatic man riven contradictions almost impossible know lauded articulate voice american freedom equality even held bondage jefferson variably described hypocrite atheist proponent li thomas jefferson often portrayed hopelessly enigmatic man riven contradictions almost impossible know lauded articulate voice american freedom equality even held bondage jefferson variably described hypocrite atheist proponent limited government expected americans farmers annette teams america leading jefferson scholar peter onuf present absorbing revealing character study dispels many accrued years third president challenging widely prevalent belief jefferson remains opaque unknowable careful analysis painstaking research vivid portrait jefferson might painted one comprised equal parts sun shadow jane kamensky jefferson philosophical development youth old age authors explore call empire jefferson expansive state mind born origins slave society intellectual influences vaulting ambition propelled public life modern avatar enlightenment time likened figure blessed patriarchs indeed jefferson saw patriarch country home monticello also family white half loved publicly well black side claimed love contradiction extraordinary historical three sections blessed patriarchs reveals striking personal dimension life part â patriarch explores jeffersons origins virgina part ii covers sojourn paris part iii enthusiast delves insightfully virginian views christianity slavery race see ideas vision america come know almost familial way importance music life blessed patriarchs fundamentally challenges much come accept jefferson neither hypocrite saint atheist fundamentalist onuf close reading words reintroduce us influential founding father man gifted complicated ways,0.9828

The Year of Living Biblically: One Man's Humble Quest to Follow the Bible as Literally as Possible,"From the bestselling author of ""The Know-It-All"" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. From the bestselling author of ""The Know-It-All"" comes a fascinating and timely exploration of religion and the Bible.Raised in a secular family but increasingly interested in the relevance of faith in our modern world, A.J. Jacobs decides to dive in headfirst and attempt to obey the Bible as literally as possible for one full year. He vows to follow the Ten Commandments. To be fruitful and multiply. To love his neighbor. But also to obey the hundreds of less publicized rules: to avoid wearing clothes made of mixed fibers; to play a ten-string harp; to stone adulterers.The resulting spiritual journey is at once funny and profound, reverent and irreverent, personal and universal and will make you see history's most influential book with new eyes.Jacobs's quest transforms his life even more radically than the year spent reading the entire ""Encyclopedia Britannica"" for ""The Know-It-All."" His beard grows so unruly that he is regularly mistaken for a member of ZZ Top. He immerses himself in prayer, tends sheep in the Israeli desert, battles idolatry, and tells the absolute truth in all situations - much to his wife's chagrin.Throughout the book, Jacobs also embeds himself in a cross-section of communities that take the Bible literally. He tours a Kentucky-based creationist museum and sings hymns with Pennsylvania Amish. He dances with Hasidic Jews in Brooklyn and does Scripture study with Jehovah's Witnesses. He discovers ancient biblical wisdom of startling relevance. And he wrestles with seemingly archaic rules that baffle the twenty-first-century brain.Jacobs's extraordinary undertaking yields unexpected epiphanies and challenges. A book that will charm readers both secular and religious, ""The Year of Living Biblically"" is part Cliff Notes to the Bible, part memoir, and part look into worlds unimaginable.

Â And yet, all was not as it seemed. Â âNobody is not a divided self, of course,â heÂ once told an interviewer,Â âbut I think itâs rather strong in my case.â Â  Hitchens wasÂ a man of many contradictions: Â  a Marxist in youth who longed for acceptance among the social elites; a peacenik who revered the military; a champion of the Left who was nonetheless pro-life, pro-war-on-terror, and after 9/11 something of a neocon; and while he railed against God on stage, he maintained meaningfulâthough largely hidden from public viewâfriendships with evangelical Christians like Francis Collins, Douglas Wilson, and the author Larry Alex Taunton. Â InÂ The Faith of Christopher Hitchens, Taunton offers aÂ very personal perspective of one of our most interesting and most misunderstood public figures.

Do we need another Lincoln biography? In Team of Rivals, esteemed historian Doris Kearns Goodwin proves that we do. Though she can't help but cover some familiar territory, her perspective is focused enough to offer fresh insights into Lincoln's leadership style and his deep understanding of human behavior and motivation. Goodwin makes the case for Lincoln's political genius by examining his relationships with three men he selected for his cabinet, all of whom were opponents for the Republican nomination in 1860: William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Edward Bates. These men, all accomplished, nationally known, and presidential, originally disdained Lincoln for his backwoods upbringing and lack of experience, and were shocked and humiliated at losing to this relatively obscure Illinois lawyer. Yet Lincoln not only convinced them to join his administration--Seward as secretary of state, Chase as secretary of the treasury, and Bates as attorney general--he ultimately gained their admiration and respect as well. How he soothed egos, turned rivals into allies, and dealt with many challenges to his leadership, all for the sake of the greater good, is largely what Goodwin's fine book is about. Had he not possessed the wisdom and confidence to select and work with the best people, she argues, he could not have led the nation through one of its darkest periods. Ten years in the making, this engaging work reveals why ""Lincoln's road to success was longer, more tortuous, and far less likely"" than the other men, and why, when opportunity beckoned, Lincoln was ""the best prepared to answer the call."" This multiple biography further provides valuable background and insights into the contributions and talents of Seward, Chase, and Bates. Lincoln may have been ""the indispensable ingredient of the Civil War,"" but these three men were invaluable to Lincoln and they played key roles in keeping the nation intact. --Shawn Carkonen Team of Rivals doesn't just tell the story of Abraham Lincoln. It is a multiple biography of the entire team of personal and political competitors that he put together to lead the country through its greatest crisis. Here, Doris Kearns Goodwin profiles five of the key players in her book, four of whom contended for the 1860 Republican presidential nomination and all of whom later worked together in Lincoln's cabinet.1. Edwin M. StantonStanton treated Lincoln with utter contempt at their initial acquaintance when the two men were involved in a celebrated law case in the summer of 1855. Unimaginable as it might seem after Stanton's demeaning behavior, Lincoln offered him ""the most powerful civilian post within his gift""--the post of secretary of war--at their next encounter six years later. On his first day in office as Simon Cameron's replacement, the energetic, hardworking Stanton instituted ""an entirely new regime"" in the War Department. After nearly a year of disappointment with Cameron, Lincoln had found in Stanton the leader the War Department desperately needed. Lincoln's choice of Stanton revealed his singular ability to transcend personal vendetta, humiliation, or bitterness. As for Stanton, despite his initial contempt for the man he once described as a ""long armed Ape,"" he not only accepted the offer but came to respect and love Lincoln more than any person outside of his immediate family. He was beside himself with grief for weeks after the president's death.2. Salmon P. ChaseChase, an Ohioan, had been both senator and governor, had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican Party, and had shown an unflagging commitment to the cause of the black man. No individual felt he deserved the presidency as a natural result of his past contributions more than Chase himself, but he refused to engage in the practical methods by which nominations are won. He had virtually no campaign and he failed to conciliate his many enemies in Ohio itself. As a result, he alone among the candidates came to the convention without the united support of his own state. Chase never ceased to underestimate Lincoln, nor to resent the fact that he had lost the presidency to a man he considered his inferior. His frustration with his position as secretary of the treasury was alleviated only by his his dogged hope that he, rather than Lincoln, would be the Republican nominee in 1864, and he steadfastly worked to that end. The president put up with Chase's machinations and haughty yet fundamentally insecure nature because he recognized his superlative accomplishments at treasury. Eventually, however, Chase threatened to split the Republican Party by continuing to fill key positions with partisans who supported his presidential hopes. When Lincoln stepped in, Chase tendered his resignation as he had three times before, but this time Lincoln stunned Chase by calling his bluff and accepting the offer.3. Abraham Lincoln When Lincoln won the Republican presidential nomination in 1860 he seemed to have come from nowhere--a backwoods lawyer who had served one undistinguished term in the House of Representatives and lost two consecutive contests for the U.S. Senate. Contemporaries attributed his surprising nomination to chance, to his moderate position on slavery, and to the fact that he hailed from the battleground state of Illinois. But Lincoln's triumph, particularly when viewed against the efforts of his rivals, owed much to a remarkable, unsuspected political acuity and an emotional strength forged in the crucible of hardship and defeat. That Lincoln, after winning the presidency, made the unprecedented decision to incorporate his eminent rivals into his political family, the cabinet, was evidence of an uncanny self-confidence and an indication of what would prove to others a most unexpected greatness.4. William H. Seward A celebrated senator from New York for more than a decade and governor of his state for two terms before going to Washington, Seward was certain he was going to receive his party's nomination for president in 1860. The weekend before the convention in Chicago opened he had already composed a first draft of the valedictory speech he expected to make to the Senate, assuming that he would resign his position as soon as the decision in Chicago was made. His mortification at not having received the nomination never fully abated, and when he was offered his cabinet post as secretary of state he intended to have a major role in choosing the remaining cabinet members, conferring upon himself a position in the new government more commanding than that of Lincoln himself. He quickly realized the futility of his plan to relegate the president to a figurehead role. Though the feisty New Yorker would continue to debate numerous issues with Lincoln in the years ahead, exactly as Lincoln had hoped and needed him to do, Seward would become his closest friend, advisor, and ally in the administration. More than any other cabinet member Seward appreciated Lincoln's peerless skill in balancing factions both within his administration and in the country at large.5. Edward Bates A widely respected elder statesman, a delegate to the convention that framed the Missouri Constitution, and a former Missouri congressman whose opinions on national matters were still widely sought, Bates's ambitions for political success were gradually displaced by love for his wife and large family, and he withdrew from public life in the late 1840s. For the next 20 years he was asked repeatedly to run or once again accept high government posts but he consistently declined. However in early 1860, with letters and newspaper editorials advocating his candidacy crowding in upon him, he decided to try for the highest office in the land. After losing to Lincoln he vowed, in his diary, to decline a cabinet position if one were to be offered, but with the country ""in trouble and danger"" he felt it was his duty to accept when Lincoln asked him to be attorney general. Though Bates initially viewed Lincoln as a well-meaning but incompetent administrator, he eventually concluded that the president was an unmatched leader, ""very near being a 'perfect man.'""

John Adams,"In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- ""the colossus of independence,"" as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as ""out of his senses""; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris ""interest"" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived. ...more",powerful epic biography david mccullough unfolds adventurous john adams brilliant fiercely independent often irascible always honest yankee patriot colossus independence thomas jefferson called spared nothing zeal american revolution rose become second president united states powerful epic biography david mccullough unfolds adventurous john adams brilliant fiercely independent often irascible always honest yankee patriot colossus independence thomas jefferson called spared nothing zeal american revolution rose become second president united states saved country blundering unnecessary war learned beyond regarded senses whose marriage wise valiant abigail adams one moving love stories american history like masterly pulitzer biography truman david mccullough john adams sweep vitality great novel riveting portrait abundantly human man vivid evocation time much drawn outstanding collection adams family letters diaries particular one thousand surviving letters john abigail adams nearly half never published provide extraordinary access private lives make possible know john adams major american founding era stunning effect previous books mccullough tells story within point view amazing eighteenth century caught events sure way knowing things would turn george washington benjamin franklin john jay british spy edward bancroft madame lafayette jefferson paris interest maria cosway alexander hamilton james madison scandalmonger james callender sally hemings john marshall talleyrand aaron burr figure panoramic chronicle importantly john quincy adams adored son adams would live see become president crucial story history relationship adams jefferson born opposites one massachusetts farmer son virginia aristocrat slaveholder one short stout tall spare adams embraced conflict jefferson avoided adams great humor jefferson little alike devotion country first ardent fellow diplomats close friends advent two political parties became archrivals even enemies intense struggle presidency perhaps vicious election history amazingly became friends ultimately incredibly died day day days july year much john adams life come surprise many readers courageous voyage frigate boston winter later trek pyrenees exploits would dared readers ever forget life encompassing huge arc adams lived longer president story ranges boston massacre philadelphia versailles louis xvi spain amsterdam court james adams first american stand king george iii representative new nation raw capital potomac adams first president occupy white house history grand scale book politics war social issues also human nature love religious faith virtue ambition friendship betrayal consequences noble ideas john adams enthralling often surprising story one important fascinating americans ever lived,0.9982

Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours. He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical -- though not most profound -- political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism. But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity. Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively. In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century. ...more",benjamin franklin founding father winks us ambitious urban entrepreneur rose social ladder shopkeeper dining kings seems made flesh rather marble bestselling author walter isaacson vivid witty biography discover franklin seems turn us history stage eyes benjamin franklin founding father winks us ambitious urban entrepreneur rose social ladder shopkeeper dining kings seems made flesh rather marble bestselling author walter isaacson vivid witty biography discover franklin seems turn us history stage eyes twinkle behind spectacles bringing franklin life isaacson shows helped define time life america best scientist inventor diplomat writer business strategist also one practical though profound political thinkers proved flying kite lightning electricity invented rod tame sought practical ways make stoves less smoky commonwealths less corrupt organized neighborhood constabularies international alliances local lending libraries national legislatures combined two types lenses create bifocals two concepts representation foster nation federal compromise man shaped founding documents america albany plan union declaration independence treaty alliance france peace treaty england constitution helped invent america unique style homespun humor democratic values philosophical pragmatism interesting thing franklin invented continually reinvented america first great publicist life writings consciously trying create new american archetype process carefully crafted persona portrayed public polished posterity trusted hearts minds fellow inbred elite saw values source social strength something derided guiding principle dislike everything tended debase spirit common people fellow founders felt comfort democracy fully none intuitively colorful intimate narrative isaacson provides full sweep franklin amazing life days runaway printer triumphs statesman scientist founding father chronicles franklin tumultuous relationship illegitimate son grandson practical marriage flirtations ladies paris also shows franklin helped create american character particular resonance century,0.994

Born into minor German nobility, she transformed herself into an empress by sheer determination. Possessing a brilliant, curious mind, she devoured the works of Enlightenment philosophers, and reaching the throne, tried using their principles to rule the vast, backward empire. She knew or corresponded with notable figures of her time: Voltaire, Diderot, Frederick the Great, Maria Theresa of Austria, Marie Antoinette & John Paul Jones. Wanting to be the âbenevolent despotâ Montesquieu idealized, she contended with the deeply ingrained realities of Russian life, including serfdom. She persevered, and for 34 years the government, foreign policy, cultural development and welfare of the Russian people were in her hands. She dealt with domestic rebellion, wars & the tides of political change and violence inspired by the French Revolution. Her reputation depended on the perspective of the speaker. She was praised by Voltaire as like the classical philosophers. She was condemned by enemies, mostly foreign, as âthe Messalina of the north.â Her family, friends, ministers, generals, lovers and enemies are vividly described.

Armed with this knowle Incisive commentary on the financial meltdown and its aftermath, from the author of the bestselling global phenomenonÂ Capital in the Twenty-First Century Thomas Piketty's work has proved that unfettered markets lead to increasing inequality. Without meaningful regulation, capitalist economies will concentrate wealth in an ever smaller number of hands. Armed with this knowledge, democratic societies face a defining challenge: fending off a new aristocracy. For years, Piketty has wrestled with this problem in his monthly newspaper column, which pierces the surface of current events to reveal the economic forces underneath. Why Save the Bankers? brings together selected columns, now translated and annotated, from the period book-ended by the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Paris attacks of November 2015. In between, writing from the vantage point of his native France, Piketty brilliantly decodes the European sovereign debt crisis, an urgent struggle against the tyranny of markets that bears lessons for the world at large. And along the way, he weighs in on oligarchy in the United States, wonders whether debts actually need to be paid back, and discovers surprising lessons about inequality by examining the career of Steve Jobs. Coursing with insight and flashes of wit, these brief essays offer a view of recent history through the eyes of one of the most influential economic thinkers of our time. ...more",incisive commentary financial meltdown aftermath author bestselling global phenomenoncapital century thomas piketty work proved unfettered markets lead increasing inequality without meaningful regulation capitalist economies concentrate wealth ever smaller number hands armed knowle incisive commentary financial meltdown aftermath author bestselling global phenomenonâ capital century thomas piketty work proved unfettered markets lead increasing inequality without meaningful regulation capitalist economies concentrate wealth ever smaller number hands armed knowledge democratic societies face defining challenge fending new aristocracy years piketty wrestled problem monthly newspaper column pierces surface current events reveal economic forces underneath save bankers brings together selected columns translated annotated period september collapse lehman brothers paris attacks november writing vantage point native france piketty brilliantly decodes european sovereign debt crisis urgent struggle tyranny markets bears lessons world large along way weighs oligarchy united states wonders whether debts actually need paid back discovers surprising lessons inequality examining career steve jobs coursing insight flashes wit brief essays offer view recent history eyes one influential economic thinkers time,0.5386

It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing -- though absurdly comic -- meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

William Geroux has unearthed a fascinating tale of one small coastal town caught in the thick of the fight, and he tells it with a sharp reporterâs eye and a real feel for the heroic men who went down to the sea in ships.â âEvan Thomas, author of Being Nixon and Sea of ThunderMathews County, Virginia, is a remote outpost on the Chesapeake Bay with little to offer except unspoiled sceneryâbut it sent one of the largest concentrations of sea captains and U.S. merchant mariners of any community in America to fight in World War II. The Mathews Men tells that heroic story through the experiences of one extraordinary family whose seven sons (and their neighbors), U.S. merchant mariners all, suddenly found themselves squarely in the cross-hairs of the U-boats bearing down on the coastal United States in 1942. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  From the late 1930s to 1945, virtually all the fuel, food and munitions that sustained the Allies in Europe traveled not via the Navy but in merchant ships. After Pearl Harbor, those unprotected ships instantly became the U-boatsâ prime targets. And they were easy targetsâthe Navy lacked the inclination or resources to defend them until the beginning of 1943. Hitler was determined that his U-boats should sink every American ship they could find, sometimes within sight of tourist beaches, and to kill as many mariners as possible, in order to frighten their shipmates into staying ashore. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  As the war progressed, men from Mathews sailed the North and South Atlantic, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and even the icy Barents Sea in the Arctic Circle, where they braved the dreaded Murmansk Run. Through their experiences we have eyewitnesses to every danger zone, in every kind of ship. Some died horrific deaths. Others fought to survive torpedo explosions, flaming oil slicks, storms, shark attacks, mine blasts, and harrowing lifeboat odysseysâonly to ship out again on the next boat as soon as they'd returned to safety.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Mathews Men shows us the war far beyond traditional battlefieldsâoften the U.S. merchant marinersâ life-and-death struggles took place just off the U.S. coastâbut also takes us to the landing beaches at D-Day and to the Pacific. âWhen final victory is ours,â General Dwight D. Eisenhower had predicted, âthere is no organization that will share its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine.â Here, finally, is the heroic story of those merchant seamen, recast as the human story of the men from Mathews. ...more",one last unheralded heroic stories world war ii assault american coast men merchant marine supplying european war one monumental contribution effortpraise mathews german war american merchant men deadly world war ii mercha one last unheralded heroic stories world war ii assault american coast men merchant marine supplying european war one monumental contribution effortpraise mathews german war american merchant men deadly world war ii merchant marine twice fatality rate navy william geroux unearthed fascinating tale one small coastal town caught thick fight tells sharp eye real feel heroic men went sea thomas author nixon sea thundermathews county virginia remote outpost chesapeake bay little offer except unspoiled sent one largest concentrations sea captains merchant mariners community america fight world war ii mathews men tells heroic story experiences one extraordinary family whose seven sons neighbors merchant mariners suddenly found squarely bearing coastal united states â â â â â â â â â â â late virtually fuel food munitions sustained allies europe traveled via navy merchant ships pearl harbor unprotected ships instantly became prime targets easy navy lacked inclination resources defend beginning hitler determined sink every american ship could find sometimes within sight tourist beaches kill many mariners possible order frighten shipmates staying ashore â â â â â â â â â â â war progressed men mathews sailed north south atlantic caribbean gulf mexico mediterranean indian ocean even icy barents sea arctic circle braved dreaded murmansk run experiences eyewitnesses every danger zone every kind ship died horrific deaths others fought survive torpedo explosions flaming oil slicks storms shark attacks mine blasts harrowing lifeboat ship next boat soon returned â â â â â â â â â â mathews men shows us war far beyond traditional merchant struggles took place also takes us landing beaches pacific final victory general dwight eisenhower predicted organization share credit deservedly merchant finally heroic story merchant seamen recast human story men mathews,-0.9951

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ours THE FIRST MAJOR WORK IN NEARLY A DECADE BY ONE OF THE WORLDâS GREAT THINKERSâA MARVELOUSLY CONCISE BOOK WITH NEW ANSWERS TO THE ULTIMATE QUESTIONS OF LIFEÂ When and how did the universe begin? Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent âgrand designâ of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motionâor does science offer another explanation? The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meetâif only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. In The Grand Design they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the âtop-downâ approach to cosmology that Hawking and Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the âmultiverseââthe idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a âmodel-dependentâ theory of reality as the best we can hope to find. And they conclude with a riveting assessment of M-theory, an explanation of the laws governing us and our universe that is currently the only viable candidate for a complete âtheory of everything.â If confirmed, they write, it will be the unified theory that Einstein was looking for, and the ultimate triumph of human reason.A succinct, startling, and lavishly illustrated guide to discoveries that are altering our understanding and threatening some of our most cherished belief systems, The Grand Design is a book that will informâand provokeâlike no other. ...more",first major work nearly decade one great marvelously concise book new answers ultimate questions lifewhen universe begin something rather nothing nature reality laws nature finely tuned allow existence beings like first major work nearly decade one great marvelously concise book new answers ultimate questions lifeâ universe begin something rather nothing nature reality laws nature finely tuned allow existence beings like finally apparent universe evidence benevolent creator set things science offer another explanation fundamental questions origins universe life province philosophy occupy territory scientists philosophers theologians disagree new book stephen hawking leonard mlodinow present recent scientific thinking mysteries universe nontechnical language marked brilliance simplicity grand design explain according quantum theory cosmos single existence history rather every possible history universe exists simultaneously applied universe whole idea calls question notion cause effect approach cosmology hawking mlodinow describe would say fact past takes definite form means create history observing rather history creates us authors explain product quantum fluctuations early universe show quantum theory predicts idea one many universes appeared spontaneously nothing different laws way hawking mlodinow question conventional concept reality posing theory reality best hope find conclude riveting assessment explanation laws governing us universe currently viable candidate complete confirmed write unified theory einstein looking ultimate triumph human succinct startling lavishly illustrated guide discoveries altering understanding threatening cherished belief systems grand design book,0.9924

Arleen is a single mo New York Times BestsellerFrom Harvard sociologist and MacArthur ""Genius"" Matthew Desmond, a landmark work of scholarship and reportage that will forever change the way we look at poverty in AmericaÂ In this brilliant, heartbreaking book, Matthew Desmond takes us into the poorest neighborhoods of Milwaukee to tell the story of eight families on the edge. Arleen is a single mother trying to raise her two sons on the $20 a month she has left after paying for their rundown apartment. Scott is a gentle nurse consumed by a heroin addiction. Lamar, a man with no legs and a neighborhood full of boys to look after, tries to work his way out of debt. Vanetta participates in a botched stickup after her hours are cut. All are spending almost everything they have on rent, and all have fallen behind. The fates of these families are in the hands of two landlords: Sherrena Tarver, a former schoolteacher turned inner-city entrepreneur, and Tobin Charney, who runs one of the worst trailer parks in Milwaukee. They loathe some of their tenants and are fond of others, but as Sherrena puts it, âLove donât pay the bills.â She moves to evict Arleen and her boys a few days before Christmas. Even in the most desolate areas of American cities, evictions used to be rare. But today, most poor renting families are spending more than half of their income on housing, and eviction has become ordinary, especially for single mothers. In vivid, intimate prose, Desmond provides a ground-level view of one of the most urgent issues facing America today. As we see families forcedÂ  into shelters, squalid apartments, or more dangerous neighborhoods, we bear witness to the human cost of Americaâs vast inequalityâand to peopleâs determination and intelligence in the face of hardship.

Dracula the Un-Dead,"At lastâthe sequel to Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, written by his direct descendant and a Dracula historian Bram Stoker's Dracula is the prototypical horror novel, an inspiration for the world's seemingly limitless fascination with vampires. Though many have tried to replicate Stoker's horror classicâin books, television shows, and moviesâonly the 1931 Bela Lugosi At lastâthe sequel to Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, written by his direct descendant and a Dracula historian Bram Stoker's Dracula is the prototypical horror novel, an inspiration for the world's seemingly limitless fascination with vampires. Though many have tried to replicate Stoker's horror classicâin books, television shows, and moviesâonly the 1931 Bela Lugosi film bore the Stoker family's support. Until now. Dracula The Un-Dead is a bone-chilling sequel based on Bram Stoker's own handwritten notes for characters and plot threads excised from the original edition. Dracula The Un-Dead begins in 1912, twenty-five years after Dracula ""crumbled into dust."" Van Helsing's protÃ©gÃ©, Dr. Jack Seward, is now a disgraced morphine addict obsessed with stamping out evil across Europe. Meanwhile, an unknowing Quincey Harker, the grown son of Jonathan and Mina, leaves law school for the London stage, only to stumble upon the troubled production of ""Dracula,"" directed and produced by Bram Stoker himself. The play plunges Quincey into the world of his parents' terrible secrets, but before he can confront them he experiences evil in a way he had never imagined. One by one, the band of heroes that defeated Dracula a quarter-century ago is being hunted down. Could it be that Dracula somehow survived their attack and is seeking revenge? Or is there another force at work whose relentless purpose is to destroy anything and anyone associated with Dracula? Dracula The Un-Dead is deeply researched, rich in character, thrills and scares, and lovingly crafted as both an extension and celebration of one of the most classic popular novels in literature. ...more",sequel bram stoker classic novel dracula written direct descendant dracula historian bram stoker dracula prototypical horror novel inspiration world seemingly limitless fascination vampires though many tried replicate stoker horror books television shows bela lugosi sequel bram stoker classic novel dracula written direct descendant dracula historian bram stoker dracula prototypical horror novel inspiration world seemingly limitless fascination vampires though many tried replicate stoker horror books television shows bela lugosi film bore stoker family support dracula sequel based bram stoker handwritten notes characters plot threads excised original edition dracula begins years dracula crumbled dust van helsing jack seward disgraced morphine addict obsessed stamping evil across europe meanwhile unknowing quincey harker grown son jonathan mina leaves law school london stage stumble upon troubled production dracula directed produced bram stoker play plunges quincey world parents terrible secrets confront experiences evil way never imagined one one band heroes defeated dracula ago hunted could dracula somehow survived attack seeking revenge another force work whose relentless purpose destroy anything anyone associated dracula dracula deeply researched rich character thrills scares lovingly crafted extension celebration one classic popular novels literature,-0.683

Whether itâs trying to impress her parents with a perfect GPA, undergoing an exorsism in the hopes of saving her toxic marriage, or maintaining the BMI of âa flapper with a touch of dysentery,â Salie is the ultimate approval seekerâan âapproval junkie,â if you will. In âMiss Aphrodite,â she recounts her strategy for winning the high school beauty pageant. (âNot to brag or anything, but no one stood a chance against my emaciated, spastic resolve.â) âWhat I Wore to My Divorceâ describes Salieâs struggle to pick the perfect outfit to wear to the courthouse to divorce her âwasband.â (âI envisioned a look that said, âYo, THIS is what youâll be missingâ¦even though youâve introduced your new girlfriend to our mutual friends, and sheâs a decade younger than I am and is also a fit model.â) In ""Ovary Achiever,"" she shares tips on how to ace your egg retrieval.

America's War for the Greater Middle East: A Military History,"Retired army colonel and New York Times bestselling author Andrew J. Bacevich provides a searing reassessment of U.S. military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades. From the end of World War II until 1980, virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East. Since 1990, virtually no American soldiers have been kille Retired army colonel and New York Times bestselling author Andrew J. Bacevich provides a searing reassessment of U.S. military policy in the Middle East over the past four decades. From the end of World War II until 1980, virtually no American soldiers were killed in action while serving in the Greater Middle East. Since 1990, virtually no American soldiers have been killed in action anywhere else. What caused this shift? Andrew J. Bacevich, one of the countryâs most respected voices on foreign affairs, offers an incisive critical history of this ongoing military enterpriseânow more than thirty years old and with no end in sight. During the 1980s, Bacevich argues, a great transition occurred. As the Cold War wound down, the United States initiated a new conflictâa War for the Greater Middle Eastâthat continues to the present day. The long twilight struggle with the Soviet Union had involved only occasional and sporadic fighting. But as this new war unfolded, hostilities became persistent. From the Balkans and East Africa to the Persian Gulf and Central Asia, U.S. forces embarked upon a seemingly endless series of campaigns across the Islamic world. Few achieved anything remotely like conclusive success. Instead, actions undertaken with expectations of promoting peace and stability produced just the opposite. As a consequence, phrases like âpermanent warâ and âopen-ended warâ have become part of everyday discourse. Connecting the dots in a way no other historian has done before, Bacevich weaves a compelling narrative out of episodes as varied as the Beirut bombing of 1983, the Mogadishu firefight of 1993, the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and the rise of ISIS in the present decade. Understanding what Americaâs costly military exertions have wrought requires seeing these seemingly discrete events as parts of a single war. It also requires identifying the errors of judgment made by political leaders in both parties and by senior military officers who share responsibility for what has become a monumental march to folly. This Bacevich unflinchingly does. A twenty-year army veteran who served in Vietnam, Andrew J. Bacevich brings the full weight of his expertise to this vitally important subject. Americaâs War for the Greater Middle East is a bracing after-action report from the front lines of history. It will fundamentally change the way we view Americaâs engagement in the worldâs most volatile region.Advance praise for Americaâs War for the Greater Middle EastâIn one arresting book after another, Bacevich has relentlessly laid bare the failings of American foreign policy since the Cold War. This one is his sad crowning achievement: the story of our long and growing military entanglement in the region of the most tragic, bitter, and intractable of conflicts.ââRichard K. Betts, director, Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies, Columbia University âAn unparalleled historical tour de force certain to affect the formation of future U.S. foreign policy . . . Every citizen aspiring to high office needs not only to read but to study and learn from this important book. This is one of the most serious and essential books I have read in more than half a century of public service.ââLieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.) âBacevich asks and answers a provocative, inconvenient question: In a multigenerational war in the Middle East, âWhy has the worldâs mightiest military achieved so little?â ââGraham Allison, director, Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, and Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvardâs John F.

Two great leadersâLord Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheonâwho held sway over an age of enforced peace are dead...victims of royal treachery. Now, from the ancient citadel of Dragonstone to the forbidding shores of Winterfell, chaos reigns, as pretenders to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms prepare to stake their claims through tempest, turmoil, and war. As a prophecy of doom cuts across the skyâa comet the color of blood and flameâsix factions struggle for control of a divided land. Eddard's son Robb has declared himself King in the North. In the south, Joffrey, the heir apparent, rules in name only, victim of the scheming courtiers who teem over King's Landing. Robert's two brothers each seek their own dominion, while a disfavored house turns once more to conquest. And a continent away, an exiled queen, the Mother of Dragons, risks everything to lead her precious brood across a hard hot desert to win back the crown that is rightfully hers. A Clash of Kings transports us into a magnificent, forgotten land of revelry and revenge, wizardry and wartime. It is a tale in which maidens cavort with madmen, brother plots against brother, and the dead rise to walk in the night. Here a princess masquerades as an orphan boy; a knight of the mind prepares a poison for a treacherous sorceress; and wild men descend from the Mountains of the Moon to ravage the countryside. Against a backdrop of incest and fratricide, alchemy and murder, the price of glory may be measured in blood. And the spoils of victory may just go to the men and women possessed of the coldest steel...and the coldest hearts. For when rulers clash, all of the land feels the tremors.

Inspired by Einstein, Coltrane had put physics and geometry at the core of his music. Physicist and jazz musician Stephon Alexander returns the favor, using jazz to answer physicsâ most vexing questions about the past and future of the universe.Following the great minds that first drew the links between music and physicsâa list including Pythagoras, Kepler, Newton, Einstein, and RakimâThe Jazz of Physics revisits the ancient realm where music, physics, and the cosmos were one. This cosmological journey accompanies Alexanderâs own tale of struggling to reconcile his passion for music and physics, from taking music lessons as a boy in the Bronx to studying theoretical physics at Imperial College, Londonâs inner sanctum of string theory. Playing the saxophone and improvising with equations, Alexander uncovered the connection between the fundamental waves that make up sound and the fundamental waves that make up everything else. As he reveals, the ancient poetic idea of the âmusic of the spheres,â taken seriously, clarifies confounding issues in physics.Whether you are more familiar with Brian Greene or Brian Eno, John Coltrane or John Wheeler, the Five Percent Nation or why the universe is less than five percent visible, there is a new discovery on every page.

The Gunning of America: Business and the Making of American Gun Culture,"Americans have always loved guns. This special bond was forged during the American Revolution and sanctified by the Second Amendment. It is because of this exceptional relationship that American civilians are more heavily armed than the citizens of any other nation.Or so weâre told.In The Gunning of America, historian Pamela Haag overturns this conventional wisdom. America Americans have always loved guns. This special bond was forged during the American Revolution and sanctified by the Second Amendment. It is because of this exceptional relationship that American civilians are more heavily armed than the citizens of any other nation.Or so weâre told.In The Gunning of America, historian Pamela Haag overturns this conventional wisdom. American gun culture, she argues, developed not because the gun was exceptional, but precisely because it was not: guns proliferated in America because throughout most of the nationâs history, they were perceived as an unexceptional commodity, no different than buttons or typewriters.Focusing on the history of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, one of the most iconic arms manufacturers in America, Haag challenges many basic assumptions of how and when America became a gun culture. Under the leadership of Oliver Winchester and his heirs, the company used aggressive, sometimes ingenious sales and marketing techniques to create new markets for their product. Guns have never âsold themselvesâ; rather, through advertising and innovative distribution campaigns, the gun industry did. Through the meticulous examination of gun industry archives, Haag challenges the myth of a primal bond between Americans and their firearms. Over the course of its 150 year history, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company sold over 8 million guns. But Oliver Winchesterâa shirtmaker in his previous careerâhad no apparent qualms about a life spent arming America. His daughter-in-law Sarah Winchester was a different story. Legend holds that Sarah was haunted by what she considered a vast blood fortune, and became convinced that the ghosts of rifle victims were haunting her. She channeled much of her inheritance, and her conflicted conscience, into a monstrous estate now known as the Winchester Mystery House, where she sought refuge from this ever-expanding army of phantoms.In this provocative and deeply-researched work of narrative history, Haag fundamentally revises the history of arms in America, and in so doing explodes the clichÃ©s that have created and sustained our lethal gun culture. ...more",americans always loved guns special bond forged american revolution sanctified second amendment exceptional relationship american civilians heavily armed citizens gunning america historian pamela haag overturns conventional wisdom america americans always loved guns special bond forged american revolution sanctified second amendment exceptional relationship american civilians heavily armed citizens gunning america historian pamela haag overturns conventional wisdom american gun culture argues developed gun exceptional precisely guns proliferated america throughout history perceived unexceptional commodity different buttons history winchester repeating arms company one iconic arms manufacturers america haag challenges many basic assumptions america became gun culture leadership oliver winchester heirs company used aggressive sometimes ingenious sales marketing techniques create new markets product guns never rather advertising innovative distribution campaigns gun industry meticulous examination gun industry archives haag challenges myth primal bond americans firearms course year history winchester repeating arms company sold million guns oliver shirtmaker previous apparent qualms life spent arming america sarah winchester different story legend holds sarah haunted considered vast blood fortune became convinced ghosts rifle victims haunting channeled much inheritance conflicted conscience monstrous estate known winchester mystery house sought refuge army provocative work narrative history haag fundamentally revises history arms america explodes created sustained lethal gun culture,0.4393

"Orchestra of Exiles: The Story of Bronislaw Huberman, the Israel Philharmonic, and the One Thousand Jews He Saved from Nazi Horrors","The compelling biography of the violinist who founded the Palestine Symphony Orchestra and saved hundreds of people from Hitlerâas seen in Josh Aronsonâs documentary Orchestra of Exiles.âThe true artist does not create art as an end in itself. He creates art for human beings. Humanity is the goal.ââBronislaw HubermanAt fourteen, Bronislaw Huberman played the Brahms Violin The compelling biography of the violinist who founded the Palestine Symphony Orchestra and saved hundreds of people from Hitlerâas seen in Josh Aronsonâs documentary Orchestra of Exiles.âThe true artist does not create art as an end in itself. He creates art for human beings. Humanity is the goal.ââBronislaw HubermanAt fourteen, Bronislaw Huberman played the Brahms Violin Concerto in Viennaâ winning high praise from the composer himself, who was there. Instantly famous, Huberman began touring all over the world and received invitations to play for royalty across Europe. But after witnessing the tragedy of World War I, he committed his phenomenal talent and celebrity to aid humanity.After studying at the Sorbonne in Paris, Huberman joined the ranks of Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein in calling for peace through the Pan European Movement. But when hope for their noble vision was destroyed by the rise of Nazism, Huberman began a crusade that would become his greatest legacyâthe creation, in 1936, of the Palestine Symphony, which twelve years later became the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.In creating this world-level orchestra, Huberman miraculously arranged for the very best Jewish musicians and their families to emigrate from Nazi-threatened territories. His tireless campaigning for the projectâincluding a marathon fundraising concert tour across Americaâultimately saved nearly a thousand Jews from the approaching Holocaust. Inviting the great Arturo Toscanini to conduct the orchestraâs first concert, Hubermanâs clarion call of art over cruelty was heard around the world. His story contains estraordinary adventures, riches and royalty, politicians and broken promises, losses and triumphs. Against near impossible obstacles, Huberman refused to give up on his dream to create a unique and life-saving orchestra of exiles which was one of the great cultural achievements of the 20th century.Includes Photographs ...more",compelling biography violinist founded palestine symphony orchestra saved hundreds people seen josh documentary orchestra true artist create art end creates art human beings humanity hubermanat fourteen bronislaw huberman played brahms violin compelling biography violinist founded palestine symphony orchestra saved hundreds people seen josh documentary orchestra true artist create art end creates art human beings humanity hubermanat fourteen bronislaw huberman played brahms violin concerto winning high praise composer instantly famous huberman began touring world received invitations play royalty across europe witnessing tragedy world war committed phenomenal talent celebrity aid studying sorbonne paris huberman joined ranks sigmund freud albert einstein calling peace pan european movement hope noble vision destroyed rise nazism huberman began crusade would become greatest creation palestine symphony twelve years later became israel philharmonic creating orchestra huberman miraculously arranged best jewish musicians families emigrate territories tireless campaigning marathon fundraising concert tour across saved nearly thousand jews approaching holocaust inviting great arturo toscanini conduct first concert clarion call art cruelty heard around world story contains estraordinary adventures riches royalty politicians broken promises losses triumphs near impossible obstacles huberman refused give dream create unique orchestra exiles one great cultural achievements photographs,0.9959

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. ""World War Z"" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?""

We the People: The Modern-Day Figures Who Have Reshaped and Affirmed the Founding Fathers' Vision of America,"What would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The no What would the Founding Fathers think about America today? Over 200 years ago the Founders broke away from the tyranny of the British Empire to build a nation based on the principles of freedom, equal rights, and opportunity for all men. But life in the United States today is vastly different from anything the original Founders could have imagined in the late 1700s. The notion of an African-American president of the United States, or a woman such as Condoleezza Rice or Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, would have been unimaginable to the men who wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, or who ratified the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. Â  In a fascinating work of history told through a series of in depth profiles, prize-winning journalist, bestselling author, and Fox political analyst Juan Williams takes readers into the life and work of a new generation of American Founders, who honor the original Foundersâ vision, even as they have quietly led revolutions in American politics, immigration, economics, sexual behavior, and reshaped the landscape of the nation. Among the modern-day pioneers Williams writes about in this compelling new book are the passionate conservative President Reagan; the determined fighters for equal rights, Thurgood Marshall and Martin Luther King, Jr.; the profound imprint of Rev. Billy Grahamâs evangelism on national politics; the focus on global human rights advocated by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt; the leaders of the gay community who refused to back down during the Stonewall Riots and brought gay life into Americaâs public square; the re-imagined role of women in contemporary life as shaped by Betty Friedan. Â  Williams reveals how each of these modern-day founders has extended the Founding Fathers original vision and changed fundamental aspects of our country, from immigration, to the role of American labor in the economy, from modern police strategies, to the importance of religion in our political discourse. America in the 21st Century remains rooted in the Great American experiment in democracy that began in 1776. For all the changes our economy and our cultural and demographic make-up, there remains a straight line from the first Foundersâ original vision, to the principles and ideals of todayâs courageous modern day pioneers. ...more",would founding fathers think america today years ago founders broke away tyranny british empire build nation based principles freedom equal rights opportunity men life united states today vastly different anything original founders could imagined late would founding fathers think america today years ago founders broke away tyranny british empire build nation based principles freedom equal rights opportunity men life united states today vastly different anything original founders could imagined late notion president united states woman condoleezza rice hillary clinton secretary state would unimaginable men wrote declaration independence constitution ratified constitution bill rights â fascinating work history told series depth profiles journalist bestselling author fox political analyst juan williams takes readers life work new generation american founders honor original vision even quietly led revolutions american politics immigration economics sexual behavior reshaped landscape nation among pioneers williams writes compelling new book passionate conservative president reagan determined fighters equal rights thurgood marshall martin luther king profound imprint rev billy evangelism national politics focus global human rights advocated first lady eleanor roosevelt leaders gay community refused back stonewall riots brought gay life public square role women contemporary life shaped betty friedan â williams reveals founders extended founding fathers original vision changed fundamental aspects country immigration role american labor economy modern police strategies importance religion political discourse america century remains rooted great american experiment democracy began changes economy cultural demographic remains straight line first original vision principles ideals courageous modern day pioneers,0.9944

But in the months that followed, it grew into something more for Ken Ilgunas. It became an irresistible adventureâan opportunity not only to draw attention to global warming but also to explore his personal limits. So in September 2012, he strapped on his backpack, stuck out his thumb on the interstate just north of Denver, and hitchhiked 1,500 miles to the Alberta tar sands. Once there, he turned around and began his 1,700-mile trek to the XLâs endpoint on the Gulf Coast of Texas, a journey he would complete entirely on foot, walking almost exclusively across private property.Both a travel memoir and a reflection on climate change,Â Trespassing Across AmericaÂ is filled with colorful characters, harrowing physical trials, and strange encounters with the weather, terrain, and animals of Americaâs plains. A tribute to the Great Plains and the people who live there, Ilgunasâs memoir grapples with difficult questions about our place in the world: What is our personal responsibility as stewards of the land? As members of a rapidly warming planet? As mere individuals up against something as powerful as the fossil fuel industry? Ultimately, Trespassing Across AmericaÂ is a call to embrace the belief that a life lived not half wild is a life only half lived. ...more",told sincerity humor wit trespassing across americais fascinating account one remarkable journey along keystone xl pipeline meditation climate change beauty natural world extremes push physically mentally started hike entire length propose told sincerity humor wit â trespassing across americaâ fascinating account one remarkable journey along keystone xl pipeline meditation climate change beauty natural world extremes push physically started hike entire length proposed route keystone xl pipeline months followed grew something ken ilgunas became irresistible opportunity draw attention global warming also explore personal limits september strapped backpack stuck thumb interstate north denver hitchhiked miles alberta tar sands turned around began trek endpoint gulf coast texas journey would complete entirely foot walking almost exclusively across private travel memoir reflection climate change â trespassing across americaâ filled colorful characters harrowing physical trials strange encounters weather terrain animals plains tribute great plains people live memoir grapples difficult questions place world personal responsibility stewards land members rapidly warming planet mere individuals something powerful fossil fuel industry ultimately trespassing across americaâ call embrace belief life lived half wild life half lived,0.9908

The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacationâeach of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal livesâand how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.

Cooking in her tiny Manhattan kitchen was, at least at first, for special occasionsâand, too often, an unnecessarily daunting venture. Deb found herself overwhelmed by the number of recipes available to her. Have you ever searched for the perfect birthday cake on Google? Youâll get more than three million results. How do you choose? Where do you start? What if you pick a recipe thatâs downright bad?So Deb founded her award-winning blog, smittenkitchen.com, on the premise that cooking should be a pleasure, and that the results of your labor canâand should beâdelicious...every time. Deb is a firm believer that there are no bad cooks, just bad recipes. She has dedicated herself to finding the best of the best and adapting them for the everyday cookâthe ones with little time to spare, little money to burn on unpronounceable ingredients, and little help in the kitchen. And now, with the same warmth, candor, and can-do spirit her blog is known for, Deb presents her first cookbookâmore than 100 new recipes, plus a few favorites from her site, all gorgeously illustrated with hundreds of Debâs beautiful color photographs.The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook is all about approachable, uncompromised home cooking: stepped-up comfort foods, stewy dishes for windy winter afternoons, an apple cake that will answer all questions: âWhat should my new signature dessert be?â âWhat is always welcome at a potluck?â âWhat did Deb consume almost single-handedly a week after having a baby?â These are the recipes you bookmark and use so often they become your own; recipes you slip to a friend who wants to impress her new in-laws; and recipes with simple ingredients that yield amazing results in a minimum amount of time.

The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century,"The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century is a voyage into the labyrinth of modern music, which remains an obscure world for most people. While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century is a voyage into the labyrinth of modern music, which remains an obscure world for most people. While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.The Rest Is Noise shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, and defied the will of dictators. Whether they have charmed audiences with sweet sounds or battered them with dissonance, composers have always been exuberantly of the present, defying the stereotype of classical music as a dying art. The narrative goes from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties, from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies. We follow the rise of mass culture and mass politics, of dramatic new technologies, of hot and cold wars, of experiments, revolutions, riots, and friendships forged and broken. The end result is not so much a history of twentieth-century music as a history of the twentieth century through its music. ...more",rest noise listening twentieth century voyage labyrinth modern music remains obscure world people paintings picasso jackson pollock sell hundred million dollars lines eliot quoted yearbook pages alienated teenagers across land classical music rest noise listening twentieth century voyage labyrinth modern music remains obscure world people paintings picasso jackson pollock sell hundred million dollars lines eliot quoted yearbook pages alienated teenagers across land classical music still sends ripples unease audiences time influence felt everywhere atonal chords crop jazz sounds populate soundtracks hollywood thrillers minimalism huge effect rock pop dance music velvet underground rest noise shows composers felt compelled create famously bewildering variety sounds purest beauty purest noise tells remarkable array maverick personalities resisted cult classical past struggled indifference wide public defied dictators whether charmed audiences sweet sounds battered dissonance composers always exuberantly present defying stereotype classical music dying art narrative goes vienna first world war paris twenties hitler germany stalin russia downtown new york sixties seventies follow rise mass culture mass politics dramatic new technologies hot cold wars experiments revolutions riots friendships forged broken end result much history music history twentieth century music,-0.2023

The Paris Wife,"A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happinessâuntil she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Followi A deeply evocative story of ambition and betrayal, The Paris Wife captures a remarkable period of time and a love affair between two unforgettable people: Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley.Chicago, 1920: Hadley Richardson is a quiet twenty-eight-year-old who has all but given up on love and happinessâuntil she meets Ernest Hemingway and her life changes forever. Following a whirlwind courtship and wedding, the pair set sail for Paris, where they become the golden couple in a lively and volatile groupâthe fabled âLost Generationââthat includes Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Though deeply in love, the Hemingways are ill-prepared for the hard-drinking and fast-living life of Jazz Age Paris, which hardly values traditional notions of family and monogamy. Surrounded by beautiful women and competing egos, Ernest struggles to find the voice that will earn him a place in history, pouring all the richness and intensity of his life with Hadley and their circle of friends into the novel that will become The Sun Also Rises. Hadley, meanwhile, strives to hold on to her sense of self as the demands of life with Ernest grow costly and her roles as wife, friend, and muse become more challenging. Despite their extraordinary bond, they eventually find themselves facing the ultimate crisis of their marriageâa deception that will lead to the unraveling of everything theyâve fought so hard for. A heartbreaking portrayal of love and torn loyalty, The Paris Wife is all the more poignant because we know that, in the end, Hemingway wrote that he would rather have died than fallen in love with anyone but Hadley. ...more",deeply evocative story ambition betrayal paris wife captures remarkable period time love affair two unforgettable people ernest hemingway wife hadley richardson quiet given love meets ernest hemingway life changes forever followi deeply evocative story ambition betrayal paris wife captures remarkable period time love affair two unforgettable people ernest hemingway wife hadley richardson quiet given love meets ernest hemingway life changes forever following whirlwind courtship wedding pair set sail paris become golden couple lively volatile fabled includes gertrude stein ezra pound scott zelda fitzgerald though deeply love hemingways life jazz age paris hardly values traditional notions family monogamy surrounded beautiful women competing egos ernest struggles find voice earn place history pouring richness intensity life hadley circle friends novel become sun also rises hadley meanwhile strives hold sense self demands life ernest grow costly roles wife friend muse become challenging despite extraordinary bond eventually find facing ultimate crisis deception lead unraveling everything fought hard heartbreaking portrayal love torn loyalty paris wife poignant know end hemingway wrote would rather died fallen love anyone hadley,0.9869

The Name of God is Mercy,"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â¢In his first book published as Pope, and in conjunction with the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis here invites all humanity to an intimate and personal dialogue on the subject closest to his heartâmercyâwhich has long been the cornerstone of his faith and is now the central teaching of his papacy. In this conversation with Vatican r NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER â¢Â In his first book published as Pope, and in conjunction with the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, Pope Francis here invites all humanity to an intimate and personal dialogue on the subject closest to his heartâmercyâwhich has long been the cornerstone of his faith and is now the central teaching of his papacy. In this conversation with Vatican reporter Andrea Tornielli, Francis explainsâthrough memories from his youth and moving anecdotes from his experiences as a pastorâwhy âmercy is the first attribute of God.â God âdoes not want anyone to be lost. His mercy is infinitely greater than our sins,â he writes. As well, the Church cannot close the door on anyone, Francis assertsâon the contrary, its duty is to go out into the world to find its way into the consciousness of people so that they can assume responsibility for, and move away from, the bad things they have done. The first Jesuit and the first South American to be elected Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis has traveled around the world spreading Godâs message of mercy to the largest crowds in papal history. Clear and profound, The Name of God Is Mercy resonates with this desire to reach all those who are looking for meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, and the healing of physical and spiritual wounds. It is being published in more than eighty countries around the world.âThe name of God is mercy. There are no situations we cannot get out of, we are not condemned to sink into quicksand.ââPope FrancisPraise for The Name of God Is Mercy âFrancis speaks succinctlyâand with refreshing forthrightness. . . . He emphasizes moral sincerity over dogma, an understanding of the complexities of the world and individual experience over rigid doctrine. . . . The pope has an easy conversational style that moves effortlessly between folksy sayings and erudite allusions, between common-sense logic and impassioned philosophical insights.ââMichiko Kakutani, The New York TimesâWhat makes his book most moving is the way in which this man, without disrespecting his own privacy or offering false bromides of modesty, opens the sacred space of his conscience to explain how he came to center his ministry, and now his papacy, around mercy.ââJames Carroll, The New YorkerâAs he has done throughout his papacy, Pope Francis shows in this book a compelling way to present Godâs love anew to a skeptical world without denying the ancient teachings of faith. But now he is challenging the entire Church to trek a new way forward.ââTime âFrancis enjoys sharing personal stories of Godâs grace and mercy in the lives of parishioners from his native Argentina, people he has known and who have recognized themselves as sinners.ââThe Washington PostâPowerful . . . Francisâs book signals a plea for a change of attitude on the part of the faithful and their pastors. . . . Bishops and priests will talk and quarrel over the text for months, even years to come. And that, perhaps, is what Francis intends.ââFinancial Times âDeepens his calls for a more merciful Catholic Church . . . The question-and-answer book is told in simple, breezy language, with the pope referring to experiences and people in his own life.ââNewsday âFrancis has offered his most detailed outline yet for the role of the Catholic church in the modern era.ââNational Catholic ReporterTranslated by Oonagh StranskyÂ From the Hardcover edition. ...more",new york times bestseller first book published pope conjunction extraordinary jubilee mercy pope francis invites humanity intimate personal dialogue subject closest long cornerstone faith central teaching papacy conversation vatican r new york times bestseller first book published pope conjunction extraordinary jubilee mercy pope francis invites humanity intimate personal dialogue subject closest long cornerstone faith central teaching papacy conversation vatican reporter andrea tornielli francis memories youth moving anecdotes experiences first attribute god want anyone lost mercy infinitely greater sins writes well church close door anyone francis contrary duty go world find way consciousness people assume responsibility move away bad things done first jesuit first south american elected bishop rome pope francis traveled around world spreading message mercy largest crowds papal history clear profound name god mercy resonates desire reach looking meaning life road peace reconciliation healing physical spiritual wounds published eighty countries around name god mercy situations get condemned sink francispraise name god mercy speaks refreshing forthrightness emphasizes moral sincerity dogma understanding complexities world individual experience rigid doctrine pope easy conversational style moves effortlessly folksy sayings erudite allusions logic impassioned philosophical kakutani new york makes book moving way man without disrespecting privacy offering false bromides modesty opens sacred space conscience explain came center ministry papacy around carroll new done throughout papacy pope francis shows book compelling way present love anew skeptical world without denying ancient teachings faith challenging entire church trek new way enjoys sharing personal stories grace mercy lives parishioners native argentina people known recognized washington book signals plea change attitude part faithful pastors bishops priests talk quarrel text months even years come perhaps francis times calls merciful catholic church book told simple breezy language pope referring experiences people offered detailed outline yet role catholic church modern catholic reportertranslated oonagh stranskyâ hardcover edition,0.9944

Eric Ries defines a startup asÂ an organization dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty. This is just as true for one person in a garage or a group of seasoned professionals in a Fortune 500 boardroom. What they have in common is a mission to penetrate that fog of uncertainty to discover a successful path to a sustainable business. The Lean Startup approach fosters companies that are both more capital efficient and that leverage human creativity more effectively.Â  Inspired by lessons from lean manufacturing, it relies on âvalidated learning,â rapid scientific experimentation, as well as a number of counter-intuitive practices that shorten product development cycles, measure actual progress without resorting to vanity metrics, and learn what customers really want. It enables a company to shift directions with agility, altering plans inch by inch, minute by minute.

In his earlier, award-winning novels, Dominic Smith demonstrated a gift for coaxing the past to life. Now, in The Last Painting of Sara de Vos, he deftly bridges the historical and the contemporary, tracking a collision course between a rare landscape by a female Dutch painter of the golden age, an inheritor of the work in 1950s Manhattan, and a celebrated art historian who painted a forgery of it in her youth.In 1631, Sara de Vos is admitted as a master painter to the Guild of St. Luke's in Holland, the first woman to be so recognized. Three hundred years later, only one work attributed to de Vos is known to remain--a haunting winter scene, At the Edge of a Wood, which hangs over the bed of a wealthy descendant of the original owner. An Australian grad student, Ellie Shipley, struggling to stay afloat in New York, agrees to paint a forgery of the landscape, a decision that will haunt her. Because now, half a century later, she's curating an exhibit of female Dutch painters, and both versions threaten to arrive. As the three threads intersect, The Last Painting of Sara de Vos mesmerizes while it grapples with the demands of the artistic life, showing how the deceits of the past can forge the present. ...more",long profound pleasure swept vivid new worlds worlds peopled characters intriguing real ca shake even long reading done earlier novels dominic smith demonstrated gift coaxing past life last painting sara de vos deftly bridges historica long profound pleasure swept vivid new worlds worlds peopled characters intriguing real ca shake even long reading done earlier novels dominic smith demonstrated gift coaxing past life last painting sara de vos deftly bridges historical contemporary tracking collision course rare landscape female dutch painter golden age inheritor work manhattan celebrated art historian painted forgery sara de vos admitted master painter guild luke holland first woman recognized three hundred years later one work attributed de vos known remain haunting winter scene edge wood hangs bed wealthy descendant original owner australian grad student ellie shipley struggling stay afloat new york agrees paint forgery landscape decision haunt half century later curating exhibit female dutch painters versions threaten arrive three threads intersect last painting sara de vos mesmerizes grapples demands artistic life showing deceits past forge present,0.8689

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking,"At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled ""quiet,"" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Goghâs At least one-third of the people we know are introverts. They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled ""quiet,"" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Goghâs sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegieâs birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a ""pretend extrovert.""This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves. ...more",least people know introverts ones prefer listening speaking reading partying innovate create dislike favor working brainstorming teams although often labeled quiet introverts owe many great contributions society van least people know introverts ones prefer listening speaking reading partying innovate create dislike favor working brainstorming teams although often labeled quiet introverts owe many great contributions society van sunflowers invention personal argued impressively researched filled indelible stories real people quiet shows dramatically undervalue introverts much lose taking reader journey dale birthplace harvard business school tony robbins seminar evangelical megachurch susan cain charts rise extrovert ideal twentieth century explores effects talks students feel alienated brash backslapping atmosphere american schools questions dominant values american business culture forced collaboration stand way innovation leadership potential introverts often overlooked draws research psychology neuroscience reveal surprising differences extroverts inspiring introduces us successful introverts witty public speaker recharges solitude talks salesman quietly taps power questions finally offers invaluable advice everything better negotiate differences relationships empower introverted child makes sense pretend extrovert extraordinary book power permanently change see introverts equally important introverts see,0.9896

Dodd becomes Americaâs first ambassador to Hitlerâs Germany in a year that proved to be a turning point in history.Â A mild-mannered professor from Chicago, Dodd brings along his wife, son, and flamboyant daughter, Martha. At first Martha is entranced by the parties and pomp, and the handsome young men of the Third Reich with their infectious enthusiasm for restoring Germany to a position of world prominence. Enamored of the âNew Germany,â she has one affair after another, including with the suprisingly honorable first chief of the Gestapo, Rudolf Diels. But as evidence of Jewish persecution mounts, confirmed by chilling first-person testimony, her father telegraphs his concerns to a largely indifferent State Department back home. Dodd watches with alarm as Jews are attacked, the press is censored, and drafts of frightening new laws begin to circulate. As that first year unfolds and the shadows deepen, the Dodds experience days full of excitement, intrigue, romanceâand ultimately, horror, when a climactic spasm of violence and murder reveals Hitlerâs true character and ruthless ambition.Â Suffused with the tense atmosphere of the period, and with unforgettable portraits of the bizarre GÃ¶ring and the expectedly charming--yet wholly sinister--Goebbels, In the Garden of Beasts lends a stunning, eyewitness perspective on events as they unfold in real time, revealing an era of surprising nuance and complexity. The result is a dazzling, addictively readable work that speaks volumes about why the world did not recognize the grave threat posed by Hitler until Berlin, and Europe, were awash in blood and terror. ...more",time place berlin william dodd becomes first ambassador germany year proved turning point professor chicago dodd brings along wife son flamboyant daughter martha first martha entranced parties pomp handsome young men third reich w time place berlin william dodd becomes first ambassador germany year proved turning point professor chicago dodd brings along wife son flamboyant daughter martha first martha entranced parties pomp handsome young men third reich infectious enthusiasm restoring germany position world prominence enamored germany one affair another including suprisingly honorable first chief gestapo rudolf diels evidence jewish persecution mounts confirmed chilling testimony father telegraphs concerns largely indifferent state department back home dodd watches alarm jews attacked press censored drafts frightening new laws begin circulate first year unfolds shadows deepen dodds experience days full excitement intrigue ultimately horror climactic spasm violence murder reveals true character ruthless suffused tense atmosphere period unforgettable portraits bizarre expectedly charming yet wholly sinister goebbels garden beasts lends stunning eyewitness perspective events unfold real time revealing era surprising nuance complexity result dazzling addictively readable work speaks volumes world recognize grave threat posed hitler berlin europe awash blood terror,-0.8271

His job no longer existed. ""I think they just want to hire younger people,"" his boss at Newsweek told him. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was, in a word, screwed. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the vague role of ""marketing fellow."" What could go wrong? HubSpotters were true believers: They were making the world a better place ... by selling email spam. The office vibe was frat house meets cult compound: The party began at four thirty on Friday and lasted well into the night; ""shower pods"" became hook-up dens; a push-up club met at noon in the lobby, while nearby, in the ""content factory,"" Nerf gun fights raged. Groups went on ""walking meetings,"" and Dan's absentee boss sent cryptic emails about employees who had ""graduated"" (read: been fired). In the middle of all this was Dan, exactly twice the age of the average HubSpot employee, and literally old enough to be the father of most of his co-workers, sitting at his desk on his bouncy-ball ""chair.""Mixed in with Lyons's uproarious tale of his rise and fall at Hubspot is a trenchant analysis of the start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them, a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to reach an IPO and cash out.

The passeng #1 New York Times BestsellerFrom theÂ bestselling author and master of narrative nonfiction comes the enthralling story of the sinking of the LusitaniaOn May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the eraâs great transatlantic âGreyhoundsââthe fastest liner then in serviceâand her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.Â Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwiegerâs U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly smallâhubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and moreâall converged to produce one of the great disasters of history. It is a story that many of us think we know but donât, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.Â  Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history. ...more",new york times bestsellerfrom thebestselling author master narrative nonfiction comes enthralling story sinking lusitaniaon may wwi entering tenth month luxury ocean liner richly appointed english country house sailed new york bound liverpool carrying record number children infants passeng new york times bestsellerfrom theâ bestselling author master narrative nonfiction comes enthralling story sinking lusitaniaon may wwi entering tenth month luxury ocean liner richly appointed english country house sailed new york bound liverpool carrying record number children infants passengers surprisingly ease even though germany declared seas around britain war zone months german brought terror north atlantic lusitania one great transatlantic fastest liner captain william thomas turner placed tremendous faith gentlemanly strictures warfare century kept civilian ships safe germany however determined change rules game walther schwieger captain happy oblige meanwhile british intelligence unit tracked told one lusitania made way toward liverpool array forces grand achingly chance fog closely guarded secret converged produce one great disasters history story many us think know erik larson tells thrillingly switching hunter hunted painting larger portrait america height progressive era full glamour suspense dead wake brings life cast evocative characters famed boston bookseller charles lauriat pioneering female architect theodate pope president woodrow wilson man lost grief dreading widening war also captivated prospect new gripping important dead wake captures sheer drama emotional power disaster whose intimate details true meaning long obscured history,0.923

Civilization and Its Discontents,"It stands as a brilliant summary of the views on culture from a psychoanalytic perspective that he had been developing since the turn of the century.

It is both witness and tribute to the late theory of mindâthe so-called structural theory, with its stress on aggression, indeed the death drive, as the pitiless adversary of eros.Civilization and Its Discontents is one of the last of Freud's books, written in the decade before his death and first published in German in 1929. In it he states his views on the broad question of man's place in the world, a place Freud defines in terms of ceaseless conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and society's demand for conformity.Freud's theme is that what works for civilization doesn't necessarily work for man. Man, by nature aggressive and egotistical, seeks self-satisfaction. But culture inhibits his instinctual drives. The result is a pervasive and familiar guilt.Of the various English translations of Freud's major works to appear in his lifetime, only one was authorized by Freud himself: The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of James Strachey.Freud approved the overall editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes, from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of the translations were done by Strachey himself; the rest were prepared under his supervision. The result was to place the Standard Edition in a position of unquestioned supremacy over all other existing versions. ...more",stands brilliant summary views culture psychoanalytic perspective developing since turn century witness tribute late theory structural theory stress aggression indeed death drive pitiless adversary discontents one th stands brilliant summary views culture psychoanalytic perspective developing since turn century witness tribute late theory structural theory stress aggression indeed death drive pitiless adversary discontents one last freud books written decade death first published german states views broad question man place world place freud defines terms ceaseless conflict individual quest freedom society demand theme works civilization necessarily work man man nature aggressive egotistical seeks culture inhibits instinctual drives result pervasive familiar various english translations freud major works appear lifetime one authorized freud standard edition complete psychological works sigmund freud general editorship james approved overall editorial plan specific renderings key words phrases addition valuable notes bibliographical explanatory many translations done strachey rest prepared supervision result place standard edition position unquestioned supremacy existing versions,-0.936

In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the worldâs greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows Full of incredible characters, amazing athletic achievements, cutting-edge science, and, most of all, pure inspiration, Born to Run is an epic adventure that began with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the worldâs greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexicoâs deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. Born to Run is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run. ...more",full incredible characters amazing athletic achievements science pure inspiration born run epic adventure began one simple question foot hurt search answer christopher mcdougall sets find tribe greatest distance runners learn secrets process shows full incredible characters amazing athletic achievements science pure inspiration born run epic adventure began one simple question foot hurt search answer christopher mcdougall sets find tribe greatest distance runners learn secrets process shows us everything thought knew running savage terrain north america reclusive tarahumara indians deadly copper canyons custodians lost art centuries practiced techniques allow run hundreds miles without rest chase anything deer olympic marathoner enjoying every mile superhuman talent matched uncanny health serenity leaving tarahumara immune diseases strife plague modern existence help caballo blanco mysterious loner lives among tribe author able uncover secrets tarahumara also find inner trained challenge lifetime race heart tarahumara country pitting tribe odd band americans including star ultramarathoner beautiful young surfer barefoot sharp wit wild exuberance mcdougall takes us science labs harvard valleys freezing peaks across north america numbers ultrarunners pushing bodies limit finally climactic race copper canyons born run rare book engage mind inspire body realize secret happiness right feet indeed us born run,0.9917

Why are some peopl In his landmark bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work-in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.ContentsIntroduction: The statue that didnÂ´t look right1.

Little did he know that among those released was Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a man who would go on to become a terrorist mastermind too dangerous even for al-Qaeda and give rise to an Islamist movement bent on dominating the Middle East.Â Â Â Â  Zarqawi began by directing hotel bombings and assassinations in Jordan from a base in northern Iraq, but it was the American invasion of that country in 2003 that catapulted him to the head of a vast insurgency. By identifying him as the link between Saddam and bin Laden, the CIA inadvertently created a monster. Like-minded radicals saw him as a hero resisting the infidel occupiers and rallied to his cause. Their wave of brutal beheadings and suicide bombings continued for years until Jordanian intelligence provided the Americans with the crucial intelligence needed to eliminate Zarqawi in a 2006 airstrike.Â Â Â Â  But his movement endured, first called al-Qaeda in Iraq, then renamed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, seeking refuge in unstable, ungoverned pockets on the Iraq-Syria border. And as the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, ISIS seized its chance to pursue Zarqawi's dream of a sweeping, ultra-conservative Islamic caliphate.Â Â Â Â Â  Drawing on unique access to CIA and Jordanian sources, Joby Warrick weaves together heart-pounding, moment-by-moment operational details with overarching historical perspectives to reveal the long trajectory of today's most dangerous Islamic extremist threat.From the Hardcover edition. ...more",pulitzer reporter joby warrick reveals strain militant islam raising banner across iraq syria spread remote jordanian prison unwitting aid american military succeeded father king abdullah jordan released batch political prisoners hopes smoothing transition pow pulitzer reporter joby warrick reveals strain militant islam raising banner across iraq syria spread remote jordanian prison unwitting aid american military â â â â succeeded father king abdullah jordan released batch political prisoners hopes smoothing transition power little know among released abu musab man would go become terrorist mastermind dangerous even give rise islamist movement bent dominating middle â â â zarqawi began directing hotel bombings assassinations jordan base northern iraq american invasion country catapulted head vast insurgency identifying link saddam bin laden cia inadvertently created monster radicals saw hero resisting infidel occupiers rallied cause wave brutal beheadings suicide bombings continued years jordanian intelligence provided americans crucial intelligence needed eliminate zarqawi â â â movement endured first called iraq renamed islamic state iraq syria isis seeking refuge unstable ungoverned pockets border syrian civil war broke isis seized chance pursue zarqawi dream sweeping islamic â â â â drawing unique access cia jordanian sources joby warrick weaves together operational details overarching historical perspectives reveal long trajectory today dangerous islamic extremist hardcover edition,-0.9756

Maybe you think itâs your ability to design tools, your sense of self, or your grasp of past and futureâall traits that have helped us define ourselves as the planetâs preeminent species. But in recent decades, these claims have eroded, or even been disproven outright, by a revolution in the study of animal cognition. Take the way octopuses use coconut shells as tools; elephants that classify humans by age, gender, and language; or Ayumu, the young male chimpanzee at Kyoto University whose flash memory puts that of humans to shame. Based on research involving crows, dolphins, parrots, sheep, wasps, bats, whales, and of course chimpanzees and bonobos, Frans de Waal explores both the scope and the depth of animal intelligence. He offers a firsthand account of how science has stood traditional behaviorism on its head by revealing how smart animals really are, and how weâve underestimated their abilities for too long.People often assume a cognitive ladder, from lower to higher forms, with our own intelligence at the top. But what if it is more like a bush, with cognition taking different forms that are often incomparable to ours? Would you presume yourself dumber than a squirrel because youâre less adept at recalling the locations of hundreds of buried acorns? Or would you judge your perception of your surroundings as more sophisticated than that of a echolocating bat? De Waal reviews the rise and fall of the mechanistic view of animals and opens our minds to the idea that animal minds are far more intricate and complex than we have assumed. De Waalâs landmark work will convince you to rethink everything you thought you knew about animalâand humanâintelligence. ...more",separates mind maybe think ability design tools sense self grasp past traits helped us define preeminent species recent decades claims eroded even disproven outright revolution study animal cognition take way separates mind maybe think ability design tools sense self grasp past traits helped us define preeminent species recent decades claims eroded even disproven outright revolution study animal cognition take way octopuses use coconut shells tools elephants classify humans age gender language ayumu young male chimpanzee kyoto university whose flash memory puts humans shame based research involving crows dolphins parrots sheep wasps bats whales course chimpanzees bonobos frans de waal explores scope depth animal intelligence offers firsthand account science stood traditional behaviorism head revealing smart animals really underestimated abilities often assume cognitive ladder lower higher forms intelligence top like bush cognition taking different forms often incomparable would presume dumber squirrel less adept recalling locations hundreds buried acorns would judge perception surroundings sophisticated echolocating bat de waal reviews rise fall mechanistic view animals opens minds idea animal minds far intricate complex assumed de landmark work convince rethink everything thought knew,0.937

A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of ""Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book,"" and a 20-page ack Dave Eggers is a terrifically talented writer; don't hold his cleverness against him. What to make of a book called A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story? For starters, there's a good bit of staggering genius before you even get to the true story, including a preface, a list of ""Rules and Suggestions for Enjoyment of This Book,"" and a 20-page acknowledgements section complete with special mail-in offer, flow chart of the book's themes, and a lovely pen-and-ink drawing of a stapler (helpfully labeled ""Here is a drawing of a stapler:""). But on to the true story. At the age of 22, Eggers became both an orphan and a ""single mother"" when his parents died within five months of one another of unrelated cancers. In the ensuing sibling division of labor, Dave is appointed unofficial guardian of his 8-year-old brother, Christopher. The two live together in semi-squalor, decaying food and sports equipment scattered about, while Eggers worries obsessively about child-welfare authorities, molesting babysitters, and his own health. His child-rearing strategy swings between making his brother's upbringing manically fun and performing bizarre developmental experiments on him. (Case in point: his idea of suitable bedtime reading is John Hersey's Hiroshima.) The book is also, perhaps less successfully, about being young and hip and out to conquer the world (in an ironic, media-savvy, Gen-X way, naturally). In the early '90s, Eggers was one of the founders of the very funny Might Magazine, and he spends a fair amount of time here on Might, the hipster culture of San Francisco's South Park, and his own efforts to get on to MTV's Real World. This sort of thing doesn't age very well--but then, Eggers knows that. There's no criticism you can come up with that he hasn't put into A.H.W.O.S.G. already. ""The book thereafter is kind of uneven,"" he tells us regarding the contents after page 109, and while that's true, it's still uneven in a way that is funny and heartfelt and interesting. All this self-consciousness could have become unbearably arch. It's a testament to Eggers's skill as a writer--and to the heartbreaking particulars of his story--that it doesn't. Currently the editor of the footnote-and-marginalia-intensive journal McSweeney's (the last issue featured an entire story by David Foster Wallace printed tinily on its spine), Eggers comes from the most media-saturated generation in history--so much so that he can't feel an emotion without the sense that it's already been felt for him. What may seem like postmodern noodling is really just Eggers writing about pain in the only honest way available to him. Oddly enough, the effect is one of complete sincerity, and--especially in its concluding pages--this memoir as metafiction is affecting beyond all rational explanation. --Mary Park ...more",dave eggers terrifically talented writer hold cleverness make book called heartbreaking work staggering genius based true story starters good bit staggering genius even get true story including preface list rules suggestions enjoyment book ack dave eggers terrifically talented writer hold cleverness make book called heartbreaking work staggering genius based true story starters good bit staggering genius even get true story including preface list rules suggestions enjoyment book acknowledgements section complete special offer flow chart book themes lovely drawing stapler helpfully labeled drawing stapler true story age eggers became orphan single mother parents died within five months one another unrelated cancers ensuing sibling division labor dave appointed unofficial guardian brother christopher two live together decaying food sports equipment scattered eggers worries obsessively authorities molesting babysitters health strategy swings making brother upbringing manically fun performing bizarre developmental experiments case point idea suitable bedtime reading john hersey hiroshima book also perhaps less successfully young hip conquer world ironic way naturally early eggers one founders funny might magazine spends fair amount time might hipster culture san francisco south park efforts get mtv real world sort thing age well eggers knows criticism come put already book thereafter kind uneven tells us regarding contents page true still uneven way funny heartfelt interesting could become unbearably arch testament eggers skill writer heartbreaking particulars story currently editor journal mcsweeney last issue featured entire story david foster wallace printed tinily spine eggers comes generation history much ca feel emotion without sense already felt may seem like postmodern noodling really eggers writing pain honest way available oddly enough effect one complete sincerity especially concluding pages memoir metafiction affecting beyond rational explanation mary park,0.995

We feel love for our companions, certainly, and happiness at the thought that weâre providing them with a safe, healthy life. But thereâs another emotion, less often acknowledged, that can be nearly as powerful: guilt. When we see our cats gazing wistfully out the window, or watch a goldfish swim lazy circles in a bowl, we canât help but wonder: are we doing the right thing, keeping these independent beings locked up, subject to our control? Is keeping pets actually good for the pets themselves? Â  Thatâs the question that animates Jessica Pierceâs powerful Run, Spot, Run. A lover of pets herself (including, over the years, dogs, cats, fish, rats, hermit crabs, and more), Pierce understands the joys that pets bring us. But she also refuses to deny the ambiguous ethics at the heart of the relationship, and through a mix of personal stories, philosophical reflections, and scientifically informed analyses of animal behavior and natural history, she puts pet-keeping to the test. Is it ethical to keep pets at all? Are some species more suited to the relationship than others? Are there species one should never attempt to own? And are there ways that we can improve our petsâ lives, so that we can be confident that we are giving them as much as they give us? Â  Deeply empathetic, yet rigorous and unflinching in her thinking, Pierce has written a book that is sure to help any pet owner, unsettling assumptions but also giving them the knowledge to build deeper, better relationships with the animals with whom theyâve chosen to share their lives. ...more",life shared pets brings many emotions feel love companions certainly happiness thought providing safe healthy life another emotion less often acknowledged nearly powerful guilt see cats gazing wistfully window watch goldfish swim lazy circles bowl life shared pets brings many emotions feel love companions certainly happiness thought providing safe healthy life another emotion less often acknowledged nearly powerful guilt see cats gazing wistfully window watch goldfish swim lazy circles bowl help wonder right thing keeping independent beings locked subject control keeping pets actually good pets â question animates jessica powerful run spot run lover pets including years dogs cats fish rats hermit crabs pierce understands joys pets bring us also refuses deny ambiguous ethics heart relationship mix personal stories philosophical reflections scientifically informed analyses animal behavior natural history puts test ethical keep pets species suited relationship others species one never attempt ways improve lives confident giving much give us â deeply empathetic yet rigorous unflinching thinking pierce written book sure help pet owner unsettling assumptions also giving knowledge build deeper better relationships animals chosen share lives,0.9969

To reassure An intimate journey across and in search of America, as told by one of its most beloved writers, in a deluxe centennial edition In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. Â  His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Â Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his lifeâa self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the Southâwhich Steinbeck witnessed firsthandâTravels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade.Â  ...more",intimate journey across search america told one beloved writers deluxe centennial edition september john steinbeck embarked journey across america felt might lost touch country speech smell grass trees color quality light pulse people reassure intimate journey across search america told one beloved writers deluxe centennial edition september john steinbeck embarked journey across america felt might lost touch country speech smell grass trees color quality light pulse people reassure set voyage rediscovery american identity accompanied distinguished french poodle named charley riding pickup truck named rocinante â course took almost forty states northward long island maine midwest chicago onward way minnesota north dakota montana fell love idaho seattle south san francisco birthplace salinas eastward mojave new mexico arizona vast hospitality texas new orleans shocking drama desegregation finally last leg alabama virginia pennsylvania new jersey new york â travels charley search america intimate look one america beloved writers later years man never wrote explicit autobiography written time upheaval racial tension steinbeck witnessed charley stunning evocation america eve tumultuous,0.9169

Bees, for example, will commit suicide when they sting to protect the hive, and birds will risk their lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk. This 30th anniversary edition of Dawkins' fascinating book retains all original material, including the two enlightening chapters added in the second edition. In a new Introduction the author presents his thoughts thirty years after the publication of his first and most famous book, while the inclusion of the two-page original Foreword by brilliant American scientist Robert Trivers shows the enthusiastic reaction of the scientific community at that time. This edition is a celebration of a remarkable exposition of evolutionary thought, a work that has been widely hailed for its stylistic brilliance and deep scientific insights, and that continues to stimulate whole new areas of research today. ...more",richard dawkins brilliant reformulation theory natural selection rare distinction provoked much excitement interest outside scientific community within theories helped change whole nature study social biology forced thousands readers rethink beliefs life internationall richard dawkins brilliant reformulation theory natural selection rare distinction provoked much excitement interest outside scientific community within theories helped change whole nature study social biology forced thousands readers rethink beliefs life internationally bestselling classic volume selfish gene dawkins explains selfish gene also subtle gene world selfish gene revolves around savage competition ruthless exploitation deceit yet dawkins argues acts apparent altruism exist nature bees example commit suicide sting protect hive birds risk lives warn flock approaching hawk anniversary edition dawkins fascinating book retains original material including two enlightening chapters added second edition new introduction author presents thoughts thirty years publication first famous book inclusion original foreword brilliant american scientist robert trivers shows enthusiastic reaction scientific community time edition celebration remarkable exposition evolutionary thought work widely hailed stylistic brilliance deep scientific insights continues stimulate whole new areas research today,0.9732

"The Sandman, Vol. 1: Preludes and Nocturnes (The Sandman (volumes) #1)","In 1916, Dream is captured and encased in a glass globe in a failed attempt by a fictional Edwardian magician (very much in the vein of Aleister Crowley) named Roderick Burgess to bind Death and attain immortality. Dream bides his time for decades until Burgess dies. Afterwards, his son Alexander becomes Dream's new captor. Finally, in 1988, Alex's guards grow careless and In 1916, Dream is captured and encased in a glass globe in a failed attempt by a fictional Edwardian magician (very much in the vein of Aleister Crowley) named Roderick Burgess to bind Death and attain immortality. Dream bides his time for decades until Burgess dies. Afterwards, his son Alexander becomes Dream's new captor. Finally, in 1988, Alex's guards grow careless and the guards watching him fall asleep in his presence, allowing Dream to use the sand from their dream to his benefit. When the guards awake and break the seal Dream was in, he is then able to escape. Dream punishes Alex by cursing him to experience an unending series of nightmares. The rest of the story concerns Dream's quest to recover his totems of power, which were dispersed following his capture: a pouch of sand, a helm and a ruby. The pouch is being kept by a former girlfriend of John Constantine's. Once that is recovered, Dream travels to hell to regain the helm from a demon, where he incurs the wrath of Lucifer (an enmity that will have major repercussions later in the series). The ruby is in the possession of John Dee, a.k.a. Doctor Destiny, a supervillain from the Justice League of America series. He has warped and corrupted the ruby, rendering Dream unable to use it, and with it he nearly tears apart the Dreaming. However, thinking that it will kill Dream, Dee shatters the ruby, inadvertently releasing the power that Dream had stored in the ruby and restoring Dream to his full power. The collection ends with ""The Sound of Her Wings"", an epilogue to the first story-arc. This issue introduces a character who has become one of the series' most popular and prominent personalities: Dream's older sister Death. She is depicted as an attractive, down-to-earth young goth girl, very unlike the traditional personification of death, and spends the issue talking Dream out of his brief post-quest depression. ...more",dream captured encased glass globe failed attempt fictional edwardian magician much vein aleister crowley named roderick burgess bind death attain immortality dream bides time decades burgess dies afterwards son alexander becomes dream new captor finally alex guards grow careless dream captured encased glass globe failed attempt fictional edwardian magician much vein aleister crowley named roderick burgess bind death attain immortality dream bides time decades burgess dies afterwards son alexander becomes dream new captor finally alex guards grow careless guards watching fall asleep presence allowing dream use sand dream benefit guards awake break seal dream able escape dream punishes alex cursing experience unending series nightmares rest story concerns dream quest recover totems power dispersed following capture pouch sand helm ruby pouch kept former girlfriend john constantine recovered dream travels hell regain helm demon incurs wrath lucifer enmity major repercussions later series ruby possession john dee doctor destiny supervillain justice league america series warped corrupted ruby rendering dream unable use nearly tears apart dreaming however thinking kill dream dee shatters ruby inadvertently releasing power dream stored ruby restoring dream full power collection ends sound wings epilogue first issue introduces character become one series popular prominent personalities dream older sister death depicted attractive young goth girl unlike traditional personification death spends issue talking dream brief depression,-0.5994

Here, one of the great modern translators presents us with The Odyssey, Homer's best-loved poem, recounting Odysseus' wanderings after the Trojan War. With wit and wile, the 'man of twists and turns' meets the challenges of the sea-god Poseidon, and monsters ranging from the many-headed Scylla to the cannibalistic Cyclops Polyphemus - only to return after twenty years to a home besieged by his wife Penelope's suitors. In the myths and legends retold in this immortal poem, Fagles has captured the energy of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom.Seven greek cities claim the honour of being the birthplace of Homer (c. 8th-7th century BC), the poet to whom the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey are attributed. The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Western literature, but the identity - or even the existence - of Homer himself is a complete mystery, with no reliable biographical information having survived.If you enjoyed The Odyssey, you might like Robert Fagles' translation of The Iliad, also available in Penguin Classics.'Wonderfully readable ...

After four years of collaboration, they produced an incisive account of their idea of Communism, in which they envisage a society without classes, private property or a state, arguing that the exploitation of industrial workers will eventually lead to a revolution in which Capitalism is overthrown. This vision provided the theoretical basis of political systems in Russia, China, Cuba and Eastern Europe, affecting the lives of millions. The Communist Manifesto still remains a landmark text: a work that continues to influence and provoke debate on capitalism and class.Gareth Stedman Jones's extensive and scholarly introduction provides an unique assessment of the place of The Communist Manifesto in history, and its continuing relevance as a depiction of global capitalism. This edition reproduces Samuel Moore's translation of 1888 and contains a guide to further reading, notes and an index.Karl Marx (1818-1883) was born in Trier, Germany and studied law at Bonn and Berlin. He settled in London, where he studied economics and wrote the first volume of his major work, Das Kapital (1867, with two further volumes in 1884 and 1894). He is buried in Highgate Cemetery, London.Friedrich Engels (1820-1895), as well as his collaboration with Marx, was the author of The Condition of the Working Class in England (1845), based on personal observations and research.If you enjoyed The Communist Manifesto, you might like Marx's Capital, also available in Penguin Classics.'The words of the Communist Manifesto flare like the fiery writing on the wall above the crumbling bastions of capitalist society: socialism or barbarism!'Rosa Luxemburg ...more",rousing call arms whose influence still felt today karl marx friedrich engels communist manifesto edited introduction gareth penguin engels revolutionary summons working classes communist manifesto one important political theories ever formulated four years collaborati rousing call arms whose influence still felt today karl marx friedrich engels communist manifesto edited introduction gareth penguin engels revolutionary summons working classes communist manifesto one important political theories ever formulated four years collaboration produced incisive account idea communism envisage society without classes private property state arguing exploitation industrial workers eventually lead revolution capitalism overthrown vision provided theoretical basis political systems russia china cuba eastern europe affecting lives millions communist manifesto still remains landmark text work continues influence provoke debate capitalism stedman jones extensive scholarly introduction provides unique assessment place communist manifesto history continuing relevance depiction global capitalism edition reproduces samuel moore translation contains guide reading notes marx born trier germany studied law bonn berlin settled london studied economics wrote first volume major work das kapital two volumes buried highgate cemetery engels well collaboration marx author condition working class england based personal observations enjoyed communist manifesto might like marx capital also available penguin classics words communist manifesto flare like fiery writing wall crumbling bastions capitalist society socialism barbarism luxemburg,0.7351

As dystopian stories like Hunger Games and Battle Royale surge in popularity, this haunting tale of a group of young boys stranded on a desert island still captivates schoolchildren around the world, raising timeless and profound questions about how easily society can slip into chaos and savagery when rules and order have been abandoned.When a plane crashes on a remote island, a small group of schoolboys are the sole survivors. From the prophetic Simon and virtuous Ralph to the lovable Piggy and brutish Jack, each of the boys attempts to establish control as the reality- and brutal savagery-of their situation sets in.A teacher himself, Golding clearly understood how to interest children with a gripping story and strong, sympathetic characters. The novel serves as a catalyst for thought-provoking discussion and analysis of universal issues, not only concerning the capabilities of humans for good and evil and the fragility of moral inhibition, but beyond.The boys' struggle to find a way of existing in a community with no fixed boundaries invites readers to evaluate the concepts involved in social and political constructs and moral frameworks. Symbolism is strong throughout, revealing both the boys' capacity for empathy and hope, as well as illuminating the darkest corners of the human spirit. Ideas of community, leadership, and the rule of law are called into question as the reader has to consider who has a right to power, why, and what the consequences of the acquisition of power may be.Often compared to Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies also represents a coming-of-age story of innocence lost. ...more",since first published william golding classic debut novel remained stark allegory civilization survival human nature dystopian stories like hunger games battle royale surge popularity haunting tale group young boys stranded desert island still captivates schoolchildren around world raising timeless pro since first published william golding classic debut novel remained stark allegory civilization survival human nature dystopian stories like hunger games battle royale surge popularity haunting tale group young boys stranded desert island still captivates schoolchildren around world raising timeless profound questions easily society slip chaos savagery rules order plane crashes remote island small group schoolboys sole survivors prophetic simon virtuous ralph lovable piggy brutish jack boys attempts establish control brutal situation sets teacher golding clearly understood interest children gripping story strong sympathetic characters novel serves catalyst discussion analysis universal issues concerning capabilities humans good evil fragility moral inhibition boys struggle find way existing community fixed boundaries invites readers evaluate concepts involved social political constructs moral frameworks symbolism strong throughout revealing boys capacity empathy hope well illuminating darkest corners human spirit ideas community leadership rule law called question reader consider right power consequences acquisition power may compared catcher rye lord flies also represents story innocence lost,0.936

Choosing Our Religion: The Spiritual Lives of America's Nones,"To the dismay of religious leaders, study after study has shown a steady decline in affiliation and identification with traditional religions in America. By 2014, more than twenty percent of adults identified as unaffiliated--up more than seven percent just since 2007. Even more startling, more than thirty percent of those under the age of thirty now identify as ""Nones""--a To the dismay of religious leaders, study after study has shown a steady decline in affiliation and identification with traditional religions in America. By 2014, more than twenty percent of adults identified as unaffiliated--up more than seven percent just since 2007. Even more startling, more than thirty percent of those under the age of thirty now identify as ""Nones""--answering ""none"" when queried about their religious affiliation. Is America losing its religion? Or, as more and more Americans choose different spiritual paths, are they changing what it means to be religious in the United States today? In Choosing Our Religion, Elizabeth Drescher explores the diverse, complex spiritual lives of Nones across generations and across categories of self-identification as ""Spiritual-But-Not-Religious,"" ""Atheist,"" ""Agnostic,"" ""Humanist,"" ""just Spiritual,"" and more. Drawing on more than one hundred interviews conducted across the United States, Drescher opens a window into the lives of a broad cross-section of Nones, diverse with respect to age, gender, race, sexual orientation, and prior religious background. She allows Nones to speak eloquently for themselves, illuminating the processes by which they became None, the sources of information and inspiration that enrich their spiritual lives, the practices they find spiritually meaningful, how prayer functions in spiritual lives not centered on doctrinal belief, how morals and values are shaped outside of institutional religions, and how Nones approach the spiritual development of their own children. These compelling stories are deeply revealing about how religion is changing in America--both for Nones and for the religiously affiliated family, friends, and neighbors with whom their lives remain intertwined. ...more",dismay religious leaders study study shown steady decline affiliation identification traditional religions america twenty percent adults identified unaffiliated seven percent since even startling thirty percent age thirty identify nones dismay religious leaders study study shown steady decline affiliation identification traditional religions america twenty percent adults identified unaffiliated seven percent since even startling thirty percent age thirty identify nones answering none queried religious affiliation america losing religion americans choose different spiritual paths changing means religious united states today choosing religion elizabeth drescher explores diverse complex spiritual lives nones across generations across categories atheist agnostic humanist spiritual drawing one hundred interviews conducted across united states drescher opens window lives broad nones diverse respect age gender race sexual orientation prior religious background allows nones speak eloquently illuminating processes became none sources information inspiration enrich spiritual lives practices find spiritually meaningful prayer functions spiritual lives centered doctrinal belief morals values shaped outside institutional religions nones approach spiritual development children compelling stories deeply revealing religion changing america nones religiously affiliated family friends neighbors lives remain intertwined,0.8087

Beyond Good and Evil,"Friedrich Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil is translated from the German by R.J.

Nietzsche Friedrich Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale with an introduction by Michael Tanner in Penguin Classics.Beyond Good and Evil confirmed Nietzsche's position as the towering European philosopher of his age. The work dramatically rejects the tradition of Western thought with its notions of truth and God, good and evil. Nietzsche demonstrates that the Christian world is steeped in a false piety and infected with a 'slave morality'. With wit and energy, he turns from this critique to a philosophy that celebrates the present and demands that the individual imposes their own 'will to power' upon the world.This edition includes a commentary on the text by the translator and Michael Tanner's introduction, which explains some of the more abstract passages in Beyond Good and Evil.Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable.If you enjoyed Beyond Good and Evil you might like Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, also available in Penguin Classics.'One of the greatest books of a very great thinker'Michael Tanner ...more",friedrich nietzsche beyond good evil translated german hollingdale introduction michael tanner penguin good evil confirmed nietzsche position towering european philosopher age work dramatically rejects tradition western thought notions truth god good evil nietzsche friedrich nietzsche beyond good evil translated german hollingdale introduction michael tanner penguin good evil confirmed nietzsche position towering european philosopher age work dramatically rejects tradition western thought notions truth god good evil nietzsche demonstrates christian world steeped false piety infected morality wit energy turns critique philosophy celebrates present demands individual imposes power upon edition includes commentary text translator michael tanner introduction explains abstract passages beyond good nietzsche became chair classical philology basel university age bad health forced retire divorced society final collapse became insane powerfully original thinker nietzsche influence subsequent writers george bernard shaw lawrence thomas mann sartre enjoyed beyond good evil might like nietzsche thus spoke zarathustra also available penguin classics greatest books great tanner,-0.7184

None of the gritty darkness or frenzied action is lost in 1st to Die, although the female protagonists offer an even deeper emotional context to this suspense thriller.Inspector Lindsay Boxer of the San Francisco Police Department suddenly finds herself in the middle of two horrifying situations: The first is that she's just learned she has an often-fatal blood disease. The second is a double homicide case she is now heading up that involves the murder of newlyweds on their wedding night. Burdened with Chris Raleigh, a new partner reassigned from the mayor's office, Lindsay finds that she has too much to deal with and turns to her best friend, Claire, the head ME on the case. Claire offers helpful advice and human, friendly contact amid a job filled with violence, cruelty, and fear.Soon a fledgling newspaper reporter, Cindy, makes contact with Lindsay looking for a career-making story. Although Lindsay can't officially comment on the case, the two women form a rapport, and Cindy joins Lindsay and Claire for their weekly meeting. When a second pair of newlyweds is murdered, and later a third, the investigation leads to a prominent crime writer, Nicholas Jenks, who has a history of spousal abuse and a predilection for kinky, dangerous sex games. With the help of an understanding assistant D.A., Jill Bernhardt, Lindsay tries to make a case against Jenks, who even had an affair with one of the slain women. Eventually Jill joins the Murder Club, and the four ladies share private interdepartmental information in an effort to track and stop the killer before he strikes again.The major subplot -- Lindsay's facing up to her illness even while she learns to fall in love again -- carefully compensates for the novel's coarse scenes of brutality. Lindsay Boxer is't merely an obsessed cop trailing a maniac; she's also a terrified woman confronting the onslaught of disease. The story lines balance out to show us the true mettle of someone who puts the safety of others before her own.Again, Patterson's skill for producing furiously paced fiction are evident as the novel breezes by rapidly. The short chapters keep the narrative leaping with increasingly taut plot elements, but there's an emotional commitment that makes our protagonist even more amiable and involving. 1st to Die is a novel that works as an intense series of character portraits that will leave the reader touched and delighted.--Tom Piccirilli ...more",james patterson bestselling author alex cross novels along came spider kiss girls pop goes weasel offers first new series dubbed women murder club featuring team occasionally works outside system none gritty darkness frenzied action lost die although female protagonists offer eve james patterson bestselling author alex cross novels along came spider kiss girls pop goes weasel offers first new series dubbed women murder club featuring team occasionally works outside system none gritty darkness frenzied action lost die although female protagonists offer even deeper emotional context suspense lindsay boxer san francisco police department suddenly finds middle two horrifying situations first learned blood disease second double homicide case heading involves murder newlyweds wedding night burdened chris raleigh new partner reassigned mayor office lindsay finds much deal turns best friend claire head case claire offers helpful advice human friendly contact amid job filled violence cruelty fledgling newspaper reporter cindy makes contact lindsay looking story although lindsay ca officially comment case two women form rapport cindy joins lindsay claire weekly meeting second pair newlyweds murdered later third investigation leads prominent crime writer nicholas jenks history spousal abuse predilection kinky dangerous sex games help understanding assistant jill bernhardt lindsay tries make case jenks even affair one slain women eventually jill joins murder club four ladies share private interdepartmental information effort track stop killer strikes major subplot lindsay facing illness even learns fall love carefully compensates novel coarse scenes brutality lindsay boxer merely obsessed cop trailing maniac also terrified woman confronting onslaught disease story lines balance show us true mettle someone puts safety others patterson skill producing furiously paced fiction evident novel breezes rapidly short chapters keep narrative leaping increasingly taut plot elements emotional commitment makes protagonist even amiable involving die novel works intense series character portraits leave reader touched tom piccirilli,-0.9935
